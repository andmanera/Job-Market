# Teaching Material Samples

Welcome to my Teaching Material page!

This collects sample recitations from my Teaching Assistant work on two MIT classes:

- 14.03 Undergraduate Microeconomic Theory And Public Policy
- 14.661 Graduate Labor Economics I

These examples encapsulate my teaching philosophy: Adopting the first learner's perspective (see 14.03 Recitation 2); providing concrete applications (see 14.03 Recitation 9 on COVID policies); adding trivia to make great economists alive (see 14.03 Recitations 7 and 8).
