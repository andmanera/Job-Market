Inventors are a scarce resource, whose skill sets can apply to R\&D
in disparate product markets. Motivated by this fact and by the fall
in R\&D productivity that characterized recent decades, I explore
the impact of product market competition on the misallocation of inventors
and growth. First, I delineate the boundaries of ``knowledge markets'',
employing USPTO patents data to group NAICS sectors that employ inventors
with similar skills. Second, I analyze the relation between 4-digit
NAICS sectors market concentration and the share of inventors employed
in R\&D projects relevant to these sectors. Four findings emerge from
the analysis. First, the last thirty years saw a sizable increase
in the concentration of inventors across NAICS sectors of application.
Second, over the period 1997-2012, increases in sector-level concentration
are positively correlated with the share of inventor markets captured
by each sector. An IV analysis based on the increase in sector-specific
regulations suggests a causal interpretation of this result. Third,
higher shares of relevant inventors are positively correlated with
rising concentration of inventors at the top of the innovating firms
distribution, and negatively with forward citations. Fourth, concentrating
sectors have seen a decrease in R\&D productivity, as measured by
growth in output per worker per inventor. A back-of-the-envelope computation
suggest that the increased concentration of inventors in less competitive
sectors can account for about 27\% of the overall decrease in output
per worker growth over the period 1997-2012 (a fall of 0.78\% in absolute
value). I interpret my findings through a Schumpeterian model of creative
destruction, where incumbents can conduct defensive patenting aimed
at increasing barriers to entry for potential competitiors. When different
product markets compete for the same inventors, unbalanced increases
in markups raise R\&D effort in concentrating sectors. As a result,
the distribution of researchers shifts in favor of incumbents carrying
out defensive innovation, which hampers creative destruction, and
lowers aggregate R\&D productivity and growth. A calibrated version
of my model reveals that allocating R\&D subsidies to entrants in
less competitive sectors is the most effective policy to maximize
growth.

\section{Introduction}

Research and Development activities are key to innovation and growth.
Yet, as documented by a growing literature, R\&D productivity and
growth have been falling over the last few decades \citep{bloomAreIdeasGetting2020,fernaldFutureUSEconomic2014,gordonRiseFallAmerican2016}.
A prominent explanation of these trends is that ``ideas are getting
harder to find'' due to increased technological complexity. A less
explored alternative sees instead growing inefficiency in the allocation
of R\&D inputs as the root cause of this phenomenon \citep{acemogluInnovationReallocationGrowth2018a,acemogluBottlenecksSectoralImbalances2021},
a concern that is echoed in the policy circles as well as the press
\citep{metzTechGiantsAre2017,bassBigTechSwallows2020}. Central in
the current policy debate is the concern that dominant big-tech firms
are inefficiently appropriating a large share of highly-educated,
highly-skilled workers, subtracting this crucial resource from more
competitive and dynamic sectors. A stark example of this phenomenon
is the high concentration of AI expert workforce. \citet{talentseer2020AITalent2020}
estimates that up to 20\% of total AI experts are employed by just
five companies: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and IBM. At the same
time, smaller firms in other economic sectors appear unable to attract
this scarce talent, raising concerns over the potential misallocation
of innovators. 

This paper studies the broader effect of increasing concentration
on the allocation of inventors across sectors, and shows that such
concerns are justified. Using USPTO patent data and concentration
measures from the Economic Census over the period 1997-2012, I demonstrate
that sectors where concentration has increased have indeed attracted
an increasing share of inventors. This relation has a causal interpretation,
according to an IV specification where I use the increase in the number
of regulations from Mercatus RegData as an instrument for increased
concentration. I establish three additional facts that suggest that
this allocation is inefficient. First, researchers accrued mostly
to incumbent firms in concentrated sectors. Second, the quality of
patents in concentrating sectors has fallen, as measured by patent
forward citations. Third, inventors' productivity, that I measure
as growth in output per worker per inventor, has fallen in these sectors.
These findings suggest that additional inventors have accrued to incumbents
who employed them on ``defensive innovation'', that is, projects
with a low growth footprint conducted with the primary aim of preventing
further entry and sheltering existing dominant positions. Quantitatively,
my findings imply that inventor misallocation implies a fall of up
to 0.78pp in output-per-worker growth in the sectors I study (28.6\%
of the overall observed reduction over the period 1997-2012). 

Methodologically, my analysis relies on a novel dataset of ``knowledge
markets,'' defined as sets of product markets that share similar
inventors. These inventor markets originate from the network generated
by transitions of individual inventors across product categories,
identified using USPTO patent data, where patents are classified according
to their main NAICS sector of applications. This classification is
crucial to avoid pooling inventors and sectors that do not share the
same technical expertise. If this were the case, the response of inventor
mobility to changes in sectoral characteristics would be biased toward
zero, as many sectors identified as potential outlets for each inventor
would in facts not be such.

In order to interpret these results, I build a Schumpeterian model
where, in addition to productive R\&D conducted by new entrants, incumbents
can engage in defensive projects to increase entry cost faced by potential
competitors. A two-sector general equilibrium model shows that unbalanced
changes in concentration across sectors generate a fall in inventor
productivity and growth. Indeed, inventors are misallocated towards
less competitive markets where defensive projects\textemdash which
hamper entry and Schumpeterian growth\textemdash are more prevalent,
and away from more competitive sectors where growth is more sustained.
The theoretical analysis shows that defensive innovation is a crucial
mechanism to generate the increased concentration of inventors among
incumbents that I find in the data, as well as the fall in R\&D productivity,
which are both absent in a framework abstracting from these features. 

I calibrate a two-sector version of my model to match moments of the
R\&D spending distribution in 1997 and growth over the period 1997-2012.
This calibration implies productivity losses from misallocation that
are close to the lower bound implied by my estimates. In the context
of this model, I study the allocation of cost-neutral R\&D subsidies
that maximizes growth. Subsidizing entrants' R\&D in more concentrated
sectors constitutes the most effective policy, leading to a rise in
annual GDP growth of about 0.5pp (17\% relative to my benchmark).
Similar results obtain if entry is uniformly subsidized across the
two sectors. This finding resonates with the fact that defensive innovation
constitutes the main friction hampering efficiency in the model. Since
this friction acts through an increase in entry barriers, the most
effective way to counter it consists in alleviating entry costs.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the following section,
I survey the related literature place my study in its context. Section
\ref{sec:Data-description} describes my data sources, focusing in
particular on the construction of knowledge markets. Section \ref{sec:Results}
reports the results of my empirical analysis. Section \ref{sec:Model}
details my theoretical framework, and conducts the policy analysis.
Section \ref{sec:Conclusion} concludes and provides directions for
future work.

\subsection{Related Literature}

My work connects to several strand in the empirical and theoretical
literature analyzing the effect of product market competition on innovation.
As detailed below, I contribute to this literature through four substantial
deviations. First, I analyze the effect of competition on the allocation
of R\&D \emph{across sectors,} while previous work has focused on
either a within-sector or economy-wide perspective. Second, I explicitly
analyze the allocation of R\&D inputs across sectors, and I do so
identifying the boundaries of markets for inventors rather than relying
on R\&D spending or similar measures of innovative effort as in previous
work. Third, I connect changes in the competitive structure to the
documented trends on falling R\&D productivity. Fourth, I study theoretically
the impact of pre-emptive innovation in a multi-sector model on R\&D
productivity, and the growth-maximizing policy in this context. Both
the focus on R\&D productivity and the policy analysis are novel to
the theoretical literature analyzing defensive innovation.

First an foremost, my paper relates to the vast literature estimating
the empirical effect of competition on innovation. \citet{aghionCompetitionInnovationInvertedU2005a}
famously documented an inverted-U relationship between competition
and innovation, whereby this relation is increasing at low levels
of competition, and decreases at high levels. Accordingly, papers
in this literature have highlighted contrasting effects of competition
on overall R\&D activity, focusing mostly on episodes of trade liberalization
\citep[see][ for an extensive review]{shuImpactTradeLiberalization2019}.
Most papers in this trend identify these effects at the firm-level,
which restricts their scope to the effect of competition within product
markets. My paper instead adopts a cross-sector view, analyzing the
effect of increased concentration in some sectors on the \emph{share
of available} \emph{R\&D resources} they appropriate. In order to
do so, I build a novel dataset of ``knowledge markets'', sets of
product markets that share the same inventors. While several papers
investigate the mobility of inventors \citep[see,  e.g., ][]{azoulayMobilityEliteLife2017,morettiEffectStateTaxes2017},
my paper is to the best of my knowledge the first to analyze the effects
of market structure on inventors' transitions across sectors.

Due to my focus on competition and innovation, my paper naturally
connects to the literatures that document increased concentration
\citep{autorFallLaborShareForthcoming,gutierrezDecliningCompetitionInvestment2017,grullonAreUSIndustries2019a},
profits and markups \citep{barkaiDecliningLaborCapital2020,deloeckerRiseMarketPower2020,eggertssonKaldorPikettyFacts2018},
as well as the growing literature documenting a fall in innovation
and R\&D productivity \citep{akcigitWhatHappenedBusiness2019a,akcigitSlowingBusinessDynamism2020,akcigitTenFactsDeclining2021,bloomAreIdeasGetting2020},
and its connection to the allocation of R\&D within and across sectors
\citep{acemogluInnovationReallocationGrowth2018a,acemogluBottlenecksSectoralImbalances2021,akcigitGrowthHeterogeneousInnovations2018}.
My contribution bridges these literatures, explicitly linking changes
in the competitive structure to the allocation of R\&D resources across
more and less concentrated sectors, as well as their deployment to
productive or defensive projects.

Several papers document the role of pre-emptive innovation in ordinary
firm operations \citep[see][ for a review of the evidence]{guellecPreemptivePatentingSecuring2012},
and the high valuation of the resulting patents \citep{abramsPatentValueCitations2013,czarnitzkiHowValuableAre2020,grimpePreemptingTechnologyCompetition2008}.
Most recently, \citet{argentePatentsProductsProduct2020a} show that,
within product markets, large firms tend to account for the bulk of
patenting activity, but are responsible for a smaller share of implemented
innovations relative to non-patenting firms. The authors interpret
this finding as evidence of defensive innovation, which provides high
value to patents of entrenched firms who can thus shelter their dominant
position from competitors. My paper builds on this literature showing
that increased concentration raises the incentives for defensive innovation,
as demonstrated by a fall in forward citations in concentrating sectors.
This result connects to the findings and the model \citet{abramsPatentValueCitations2013},
who study the cross-sectional relation between patent value and forward
citations theoretically, showing that high-value patents also tend
to receive less citations, and rationalize this result through pre-emptive
innovation. 

On a theoretical standpoint, I embed defensive patenting as modeled
in \citep{abramsPatentValueCitations2013} into a Schumpeterian growth
model, building on the extensive literature inaugurated by \citet{aghionModelGrowthCreative1992}.
In particular, my solution relies on several results derived by \citet{acemogluIntellectualPropertyRights2012}.
To the best of my knowledge, my paper is the first to analyze the
impact of defensive innovation in the context of general-equilibrium
growth model. The closest precedent to this analysis is \citet{joDefensiveInnovationFirm2019},
who builds on \citet{akcigitGrowthHeterogeneousInnovations2018},
and defines their incremental innovation, that is innovation conducted
on existing product lines available to incumbents, as ``defensive''.
Therefore, in his framework, defensive innovation corresponds to incremental
innovation aimed at ``escaping competition'' from entrants by increasing
the technological distance of incumbents from entrants, in the tradition
of \citet{aghionCompetitionImitationGrowth2001}. By contrast, in
my framework defensive innovation is specifically aimed at protecting
dominant positions and reduce entry as in \citet{abramsPatentValueCitations2013},
who however do not consider the effects of defensive innovation on
R\&D productivity and overall innovation. My final contribution consists
in analyzing the growth-maximizing allocation of R\&D subsidies, which
has not been previously studied in a framework featuring defensive
innovation.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work\label{sec:Conclusion}}

In this paper, I have proposed and documented a novel explanation
for the observed decline in growth and R\&D productivity over the
last few decades. 

My empirical results showed that increasing misallocation of inventors
across different product markets can account for up to $27\%$ of
the observed decline in output per worker growth in the sectors I
analyze. This misallocation resulted from uneven increases in concentration
across product markets, which were accompanied by an increase in the
share of inventors accruing to less competitive sectors. I interpret
my findings as resulting from an increase in defensive innovation
in concentrated sectors, defined as R\&D activities conducted with
the primary aim of blocking further entry, which manifest in the data
as a fall in patents' forward citations and an increased share of
inventors employed by the largest incumbents in these sectors.

The theoretical analysis examined the effects of defensive innovation
in a Schumpeterian model of creative destruction, where incumbents
can conduct defensive innovation to raise new entrants' costs. In
the model, pre-emptive innovation is crucial to generate misallocation
across sectors, which would not occur in the absence of this mechanism.
Having established the importance of this channel, I employed a calibrated
two-sector version of the model to study the growth-maximizing allocation
of R\&D subsidies across sectors, as well as between incumbents and
entrants. My analysis suggests that R\&D subsidies provided to entrants
constitute the most effective policy, directly tackling the friction
generated by defensive innovation, and can increase growth by up to
17\% of my baseline (0.5pp in absolute terms).

Two main directions for future research stand out. First, it would
be important to investigate the validity of my findings to an international
context. Indeed, many findings in the literature of competition and
innovation depend strongly on the country and the period analyzed.
Second, my paper highlights the role of pre-emptive innovation as
a major driver of the fall in R\&D productivity. However, this topic
is still relatively under-explored, and a thorough investigation of
the evolution, causes and consequences of this phenomenon seems highly
relevant in view of my results.
