\begin_layout Standard
My empirical analysis relies on the variation of concentration across product
 markets, as defined by 4-digit NAICS sectors, the impact of these shifts
 on the allocation of inventors with specific competences across these sectors,
 and the subsequent effect on inventor productivity.
 I use USPTO patent data to measure inventor productivity and establish
 the set of product markets that share similar inventors, and US Economic
 Census data to obtain concentration and productivity growth measures.
 Finally, I use a dataset of product market regulations, Mercatus RegData
 4.0, to conduct an instrumental variable analysis, as well as NBER-CES to
 estimate the Lerner Index for the calibration of my theoretical model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My primary source is USPTO patent data from PatentsView.
 This dataset contains disambiguated patent, inventor, and assignee identifiers,
 as well as Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) classes for each of
 the patents registered from 1975 to 2021.
 I identify inventor flows across different sectors employing the ALP classifica
tion of 1976-2016 patents into NAICS sectors of application developed by
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "goldschlagAlgorithmicLinksProbabilities2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Since this classification is constructed using the PATSTAT dataset, I rely
 on the crosswalk built by Gianluca Tarasconi to match these two sources.

 This leaves me with one third of all the patents registered between 1975
 and 2021, due to the restriction of the time frame to 1976-2016 and incomplete
 matching between PATSTAT and PatentsView.
 I comb patent records for self-citations, truncation-corrected forward
 citations, and patent generality, following

 provide data on patents enforced in litigation cases between 2003 and 2016.
 This dataset allows me to analyze the evolution in patent litigation across
 NAICS 4-digit sectors for the sub-period 2002-2012.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My main source for concentration and sales data is the US Economic Census
 (EC), which reports sales shares for the top 4, 8, 20, and 50 firms; the
 Herfindal-Hirschman Index; sales and number of companies in various NAICS
 4-digit sectors at a 5-year frequency.
 I focus on the period between 1997 and 2012 for three reasons.
 First, as I show below, this period saw substantial increase in the concentrati
on of inventors in specific technology classes.
 Second, the start of this period coincides with an acceleration of market
 concentration and markups

.
 Third, 1997 saw the adoption of the NAICS classification, ensuring a consistent
 definition of product markets throughout the period I analyze.
 I select the HHI lower bound 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "keilTroubleApproximatingIndustry2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 as a measure of concentration, instead of the Economic Census HHI, which
 is available for only a subset of industries.

 The method proposed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 allows me to analyze a larger sample of sectors, since it requires only
 top sales shares in the Economic Census, which are available for a much
 wider set of industries (157 industries versus just 80 reporting a Census-compu
ted HHI measure in my sample).

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The expression used to obtain this measure is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{\ensuremath{\underbar{HHI}}}_{p,t} & =4\left[\frac{\text{CR4}_{p,t}}{4}\right]^{2}+4\left[\frac{\text{CR8}_{p,t}-\text{CR4}_{p,t}}{4}\right]^{2}+12\left[\frac{\text{CR20}_{p,t}-\text{CR8}_{p,t}}{12}\right]^{2}+30\left[\frac{\text{CR50}_{p,t}-\text{CR20}_{p,t}}{30}\right]^{2},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CR{X}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 denotes the concentration ratio, that is the share of sales, of the top
 X firms.
 This measure is a lower bound, and coincides with the actual HHI if the
 sector has less than 50 firms, and sales share are distributed equally
 in each of the top 0-4, 5-8, 9-20, 21-50 brackets.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 reports a correlation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\ensuremath{\underbar{HHI}}}$
\end_inset

 with the actual index of 0.93.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The Economic Census also provides sector-level growth in output per worker,
 which constitutes my main measure of productivity growth.
 I choose this measure instead of multi-factor productivity since the latter
 is available for selected sectors, mostly in manufacturing.
 I deflate sales using NAICS-specific price indices from the Bureau of Labor
 Statistics.
 All told, out of a total of 304 NAICS 4-digit sectors, I have assembled
 157 business sectors for which I can measure the interrelation between
 concentration and knowledge markets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I employ two additional data sources.
 First, I obtain sector-specific counts of regulations for various NAICS
 4-digit sector from the Mercatus RegData 4.0 dataset.
 I employ them to conduct an instrumental variable analysis, strengthening
 the causal interpretation of my results.

 Each node in the Figure represents a different NAICS 4-digit sector, and
 the black lines designate inventor flows, with thickness proportional to
 the size of the flow.
 I describe below how flows are computed.
 I employ a community detection algorithm to group together sectors most
 closely connected.
 Figure

 depicts strong flows among grain, vegetable farming and animal food manufacturi
ng, all of which involve knowledge related to agriculture and nutrition,
 and separately between footwear and tanning, which both require knowledge
 of leather crafting.
 In this illustrative example, my algorithm would identify two knowledge
 markets, one given by the agriculture and food manufacturing sectors, and
 the other by leather crafting sectors, leaving the laundry services sector
 isolated.
 Based on the strength of these connections, we would expect market conditions
 in footwear manufacturing to affect the distribution of inventors across
 the two leather crafting sectors, leaving agriculture and nutrition sectors
 largely unaffected.

\end_inset

 classification for NAICS 4-digit industries.
 This classification is not limited to a single sector per patent, and includes
 multiple sectors in almost all instances.
 For instance, patent US00001 relates to multiple sectors, while patent
 US00002 is applicable to just one sector.
 Importantly, this classification captures the 
\emph on
technological nature
\emph default
 of the patent and the sectors of application of the knowledge required
 to develop that patent.
 While other classifications, like the CPC or the USPC, also describe the
 technological nature of patents, they do not allow a direct match to sectors
 of application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I define a transition in two ways.
 First, I consider transitions 
\emph on
within patents.

\emph default
 This transition occurs between two sectors if an inventor works on a patent
 that applies to both.
 The direction of flows does not matter for the definition of knowledge
 markets, since I am only interested in grouping sectors that exchange researche
rs.
 Table

reference "tab:Data"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 depicts two transitions between sectors 1111 and 1112 in 1980.
 The second type of transition that I consider is 
\emph on
across patents
\emph default
.
 This transition occurs when an inventor applies his knowledge to patents
 in different product markets, such as between sector 1112 and 3111 by inventor
 00001-1.
 Raw transition counts are the basis of my measure of inventor flows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Weighting Inventor Flows: Effective Inventors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I construct two alternative measures to assess the effective flow of inventors
 across sectors.
 The first measure weighs each transition equally, computing inventor flows
 as the raw count of researchers moving across NAICS.
 The second measure adjusts for the productivity of individual inventors,
 since raw counts might overstate or understate the importance of each transitio
n, depending on the size of origin and destination sectors, their technological
 nature, as well as the proficiency of each inventor.
 I therefore define a measure of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

effective inventors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to correct for these and other omitted factors.
 For each inventor, I estimate the fixed effect, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i},$
\end_inset

 in the fully-saturated regression 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\text{\#Patents}_{cfit} & =\alpha_{i}+\gamma_{cft}+\varepsilon_{cfit},\label{eq:one-1-1}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\#Patents}_{cfit}$
\end_inset

 denotes the number of patents registered in CPC class 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

; firm (assignee) 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

; and year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, that include inventor 
\begin_inset Formula $i.$
\end_inset

 In this regression 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{cft}$
\end_inset

 denotes a of CPC class by firm (assignee) by year fixed effect.
 I choose to include indicators for one-digit CPC classes, the broadest
 classification, to identify as many fixed effects as possible.
 The fixed effect 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{cft}$
\end_inset

 controls for specific technological features of the patented technology,
 the firm environment, as well as the year.
 Further, this specification produces an estimate of inventor productivity
 that accounts for the number of collaborators on each patent.
 Given this specification, I define an 
\emph on
effective inventor
\emph default
 as one unit of the resulting fixed effect 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

, rescaled to take nonnegative values.
 Since these fixed effects might be inconsistently estimated, I check the
 robustness of all my results, including the construction of knowledge markets,
 to the use of the raw count of inventors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I define 
\emph on

\emph default
 between sector 
\begin_inset Formula $j$

\begin_inset Formula $t$

 as:

\end_inset

that is, the sum of transition counts weighted by effective inventors.

This flow measure defines a network of inventor transitions across product
 markets, where the nodes, 
\begin_inset Formula $j,k$
\end_inset

, are given by 4-digit NAICS codes and edges are transitions across sectors.
 Edge weights are a rescaled version of 
\begin_inset Formula $flow_{jk}$
\end_inset

 and measure the strength of the connection between pairs of sectors in
 the network.
 Rescaling the flow measure is necessary to remove mechanical effects of
 sector sizes and to avoid double counting of inventors.

 This procedure maximizes the modularity of the network by choosing the
 number of communities (knowledge markets) and the assignment of nodes (NAICS
 sectors) to communities.
 Modularity, a commonly used measure of connectedness of networks, measures
 the distance between the density of links

This procedures produces 10 sets of NAICS 4-digit sectors that share the
 same inventors and have concentration measures.
 Applying the community detection algorithm results in knowledge markets
 that do not overlap: Each NAICS 4-digit sector belongs to one and only
 one knowledge market.
 Figure

 displays the result of my procedure applied to NAICS 3-digit sectors.
 I report this exercise since the 4-digit equivalent would be too dense
 to depict.
 However, the knowledge markets identified by the two exercises are qualitativel
y similar although they are clearly more numerous in the 4-digit case.
 In this figure, lines denote inventor transitions, with width proportional
 to the effective undirected inventor flow between sectors.
 Black lines depict flows within knowledge markets, while gray lines represent
 transitions between communities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three features are worth emphasizing.
 First, the network is very dense, and transitions across 3-digit as well
 as 2-digit sectors are pervasive, differing largely in intensity.
 The approach I propose is therefore far more illuminating than grouping
 sectors based on broad product markets, which would neglect the linkages
 across disparate markets, or pooling all sectors together, which would
 neglect the difference in the strength of inventor flows.
 Second, the flows between communities appear more numerous than within
 communities, but this is solely a by-product of the circular layout of
 the network, whereby nodes mask flows within close communities on the circle.
 Less than a third of flows occur between communities, as expected since
 the community detection algorithm maximizes the density of within-community
 linkages.
 Third, the classification sensibly groups together sectors that we might
 expect to share similar knowledge to innovate.
 Starting from sector 111 and going counter-clockwise, the knowledge markets
 are as follows.
 The first market groups sectors involving agricultural production (111,
 112 and 114) and food manufacturing (311).
 The second market, starting with 211, includes oil, gas, and mining.
 The green cluster at the top of the figure groups several heavy manufacturing
 industries, such as chemicals, plastics and petroleum products, and pipeline
 transportation (486).
 The market in yellow consists largely of transportation services and manufactur
ing as well as motor vehicle dealers.
 The large blue cluster captures many retail sectors, as well as data processing
, telecom, and broadcasting services.
 The remaining three markets include insurance and finance (red cluster),
 computer, electronics, machinery manufacturing and professional services
 (violet), and wholesalers (gray).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I identify knowledge markets using effective inventors, but I obtain nearly
 identical results using raw inventor counts; more than 97% of 4-digit NAICS
 sectors are classified in the same manner using the two measures.
 That is, 97% of sector pairs belong to the same knowledge market according
 to both measures.

Patent Citation Measures

\begin_layout Standard
For each patent classified by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "goldschlagAlgorithmicLinksProbabilities2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I compute forward citations, a measure of patent generality, and self-citation
s.
 I describe self-citation measures together with the related estimation
 results in the Appendix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I count forward citations and measure patent generality following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hallNBERPatentCitation2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The forward citation measures compute the average number of citations received
 by each firm's patents, giving an indication of the importance of each
 patent for future technological developments.
 As in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hallNBERPatentCitation2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I correct for truncation by estimating the empirical CDF of the forward
 citations lag distribution of patents in the relevant CPC 2-digit technology
 class, and dividing the overall number of forward citations at the latest
 available date by the inverse of this CDF.
 The procedure suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hallNBERPatentCitation2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 uses only information pertaining to the CPC 2-digit technology class of
 the cited patent.
 I also compute an alternative correction that estimates a separate distribution
 for each citing CPC 2-digit class and sums the corrected forward citations
 across all citing classes.
 Patent generality also measures the scope of application of the patent
 by computing the dispersion of citations received across different CPC
 classes.
 The higher the dispersion, the wider the technological applicability of
 the patent.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Regulation Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mercatus RegData provides a count of restrictions imposed on a number of
 NAICS 4-digit product markets, obtained by matching a set of keywords in
 NAICS descriptions to regulatory texts, and then taking the best match
 for each document.
 However, the available data does not include a set of codes due to data
 quality reasons.
 Therefore, I process the description of NAICS 4-digit codes and compute
 the cosine-similarity between all pairs of sectors.
 I build an estimate of sector-relevant restrictions for missing sectors
 by taking an average weighted by cosine similarity of sectors included
 in RegData.
 I include in the average the five most similar NAICS codes if similarity
 is larger than .2, and I attribute the regulations of the most similar sector
 otherwise.
 I chose this threshold by inspecting the similarity associated to various
 NAICS pairs, and the assignment of regulations to sectors is not highly
 sensitive to this choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Inventor Distribution Measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I employ the measure of effective inventors constructed as detailed above
 to compute measures of researchers' concentration within sectors for each
 year in my sample.
 Specifically, I use the PatentsView assignee ID to identify firms that
 employ specific inventors in each sector, and then compute several measures
 of the concentration of inventors within sectors.
 I also compute the HHI of inventors across NAICS to document increasing
 concentration of inventors in specific sectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Patent Litigation Cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I match the data on litigation cases compiled by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "schwartzUSPTOPatentNumber2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 with the data on inventors by NAICS 4-digit.
 For each sector, I compute the number of litigation cases per patent.
 These data are available only for the sub-period 2003-2016, which does
 not allow me to reliably estimate an empirical CDF to correct for truncation.
 I therefore choose to keep only the litigation cases occurring in the same
 year as the patent registration, which amounts to assuming that the time
 profile of cases is constant over time and across sectors.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
More precisely, this would be the same as using only the contemporaneous
 patent litigation cases and correcting for truncation dividing by the inverse
 CDF at period 0, which would scale the estimated coefficient upwards.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 I then average the litigations per patent over the years 2003-2006 and
 2013-2016 for the Economic Census waves 2002 and 2012.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Aggregation at Census Frequency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data from the Economic Census are available at five-year intervals for the
 years 1997-2017, which requires aggregating the other data at the same
 frequency.
 Since I am interested in the effect of concentration on the allocation
 of inventors, I average all variables related to inventors and productivity
 using the five-year window 
\emph on
starting
\emph default
 in the census year (e.g., 1997- 2001 for 1997), while I use concentration
 measures for the corresponding census year.
 In the IV regression I use product restrictions as an instrument for concentrat
ion, which is why I average restrictions in the five-year window 
\emph on
ending
\emph default
 in the census year (e.g., 1993-1997 for 1997).
 Since 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "goldschlagAlgorithmicLinksProbabilities2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

's matching only covers the period up to 2016, I run all specifications
 in long-differences over the time frame 1997-2012.
 The only exception is the patent litigation regression, which uses the
 period 2002-2012.
