Empirical Analysis
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section presents five main findings that apply to the periods under
 consideration: (i) effective inventors became more concentrated across
 economic sectors; (ii) sectors with increased product market concentration
 attracted a growing share of relevant inventor types; (iii) growth in the
 share of relevant inventors negatively correlated with inventor productivity,
 as measured by forward citations as well as average growth in output per
 worker divided by effective inventors employed; (iv) growth in the share
 of inventors coincided with increased concentration of inventors 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 sectors; and (v) growth in inventor shares are positively correlated with
 increases in patent enforcement cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results (i) and (ii) indicate a positive causal link between the growth
 in product market concentration and the increase in sectors' inventor share.
 Findings (iii), (iv) and (v) point to misallocation: Inventor concentration
 in less competitive sectors turns out to be inefficient, as researchers
 are predominantly employed on projects that do not contribute to the growth
 of the sector.
 This work amounts to defensive innovation, as evidenced by the decline
 in forward citations of patents obtained by these firms, the decrease in
 growth per inventor, and the increase in patent litigations that accompany
 the increase in product market concentration.
 I discuss the causal interpretation of my results through an IV specification
 in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:MainResults"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Variable Definitions and Main Specification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Key to my analysis are measures of inventor concentration and of R&D productivit
y.
 I rely on the definition of effective inventors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

, explained in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:KnowledgeMarkets"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 For each product market 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, I define the share of inventors employed by the sector in year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Inventor\ Share}{}_{p,t}\equiv\frac{\sum_{p(i,t)=p}\alpha_{i}}{\sum_{k(i,t)=k}\alpha_{i}},
\]

\end_inset

where the numerator sums effective inventors in product market 
\begin_inset Formula $p,$
\end_inset

 and the denominator computes total effective inventors in the relevant
 knowledge market.
 I also use effective inventors 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 to evaluate the dispersion of inventors across sectors.
 Results are robust to using raw counts of researchers instead of effective
 inventors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When analyzing R&D productivity I focus on two patent-based measures described
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Other data and aggregation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

â€”forward citations and patent generality.
 Further, I compute a more direct measure of the productivity of inventors
 as the growth in output per worker divided by the number of effective inventors
 employed by the sector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In most specifications, the independent variables are measures of concentration
 and controls for the size of the sector considered.
 As discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Data-Sources"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, my baseline measure of concentration is the lower bound of the Herfindal-Hirsc
hman Index constructed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "keilTroubleApproximatingIndustry2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which I label 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\text{HHI}}_{p,t}$
\end_inset

.
 I show below that the Economic Census HHI and its lower bound, when both
 available, produce equivalent results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I obtain measures of sales from the Economic Census, which I deflate using
 BLS NAICS-specific price indexes.
 I use sales variables for two purposes.
 First, real sales in 2012 are the weight in my regressions.
 Second, I use the logarithm real sales as well as a quartic in real sales
 to control for changes in the size of sectors during my sample period.
 For the selected subset of sectors that reports the number of companies,
 I show that my findings are robust to controlling for sales per company,
 a proxy for the average firm size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I estimate a sector-level long-difference regression over the period 1997-2012
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta\text{Share}_{p,\ 2012-1997}=f_{k}\mathbf{1}\left\{ p\in k\right\} \ +\ \beta\Delta\underline{\text{HHI}}_{p,\ 2012-1997}\ +\ \gamma'\Delta\text{Size}_{p,\ 2012-1997}\ +\ \varepsilon_{p},\label{eq: spec}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\text{Share}$
\end_inset

 denotes the change in the inventors' share of product market 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{k}\mathbf{1}\left\{ p\in k\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a dummy variable that takes value 1 if the product market belongs to
 knowledge market 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\underline{\text{HHI}}$
\end_inset

 is the change in the HHI lower bound; and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\text{Size}$
\end_inset

 is a set of controls for the size of sector 
\emph on
p
\emph default
.
 Depending on the specification, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\text{Size}$
\end_inset

 is the change in log real sales, the change in log real sales per firm,
 or a quadratic polynomial in real sales changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regressions are weighted by sector sales in 2012 for the findings which
 rely on Economic Census sector-level measures, and I estimate robust standard
 errors in all specifications.
 When looking at patent measures, I employ the same specification as in
 equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: spec"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, where I replace the outcome variable with the change in patent productivity
 and the independent variable with the change in inventors' share.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As I will show, the change in the inventor share is highly correlated with
 the change in the HHI, so this specification essentially amounts to a rescaling
 of the coefficient that would be obtained using the HHI.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In this case, since I do not rely on Economic Census measures, I report
 unweighted regressions.
 I discuss the robustness of these findings to using the HHI lower bound
 and weighting by sales.

 Panel (a) depicts the share of effective inventors and panel (b) that of
 raw inventors.
 I use the HHI index of inventor shares accruing to each sector as a measure
 of concentration.
 Both panels display an increasing concentration of inventors beginning
 in the late 1990s.
 The increase in inventor concentration is sizable, corresponding to about
 a 20% increase in the HHI for the effective inventor measure over the period
 1997-2012.
 Based on raw inventor data, the figure rises to 30%.

A similar pattern emerges for concentration in specific CPC classes (available

\end_layout

\end_inset

 As for the results presented below, the effective inventor measure and
 the raw inventor count behave similarly, although the figure for effective
 inventors is less volatile since this measure derives from a regression
 that residualizes time, firm, and technology class fixed effects.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) obtained regressing the change in knowledge-market inventor share over
 either the change in the lower bound of the Herfindal- Hirschman Index
 or the HHI reported by the Economic Census.
 The results in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvNoctrl"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 highlight a strong positive correlation between the change in the HHI and
 the change in the share of effective inventors accruing to each NAICS sector.
 These results are unlikely to be driven by the contemporaneous correlation
 between the two variables, as the share of effective inventors is averaged
 over the five years 
\emph on
starting
\emph default
 in the Economic Census year, while concentration measures refer to the
 Economic Census year only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two important notes on the scale of the variables are in order.
 First, here and in all following tables and graphs, all variables that
 refer to shares or growth rates are reported in percentage points.
 Second, HHI indices are constructed to range between 0 and 1.
 With regard to the coefficient in Column (1) of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvNoctrl"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, for example, an increase in one unit of the HHI index leads to an increase
 in the share of the relevant knowledge market of 
\begin_inset Formula $27.25$
\end_inset

 percentage points.
 In 2012, the HHI lower bound has a sales-weighted average of .03 and a standard
 deviation of .032.
 According to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvNoctrl"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, a standard deviation increase in this measure yields a .87 percentage point
 increase in the share of inventors accruing to the relevant NAICS sector.
 In comparison, the sales-weighted average share of inventors in 2012 is
 1.18%, with a standard deviation of 1.82%, so the estimated effect of a one
 standard deviation increase in concentration corresponds to about half
 a standard deviation increase in the share of inventors.
 The estimates using the HHI lower bound tend to be noisier as this is a
 constructed, and therefore imprecise, measure of concentration.
 However, the number of available observations is much larger than the actual
 HHI, allowing me to extend my findings to about double the number of sectors.

\begin_layout Standard
While suggestive, the correlation presented above neglects two fundamental
 components.
 First, it does not include controls for the size of the sectors or firms,
 which could have a mechanical effect on the share of scientists.
 Second, it estimates the correlation both across and within knowledge markets.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvHHI"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 addresses these two limitations by restricting the analysis to within knowledge
 markets, and controlling for two measures of size.
 The upper panel uses the change in the logarithm of real sales to measure
 the change in the size of each sector, while the lower panel includes average
 sales per firm as a control for average firm size.
 Indeed, there might be significant barriers to entry in R&D, easier to
 overcome for larger firms, which would imply a mechanical link between
 concentration and inventor shares.
 Since the Economic Census reports the number of companies only for a subset
 of firms, the sample in the lower panel is smaller.
 Results are largely unchanged relative to the baseline.
 All told, these findings imply that sectors with increasing concentration
 have attracted a rising share of scientists above what would be predicted
 by their expansion in overall sales and in average firm size.
 Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
More concentration could be the result of increasing technological entry
 barriers as incumbents hire more R&D inventors.
 In this scenario, the causality would flow from increased inventor shares
 to higher concentration.
 Above, I tried to mitigate this concern using as outcome variable the average
 share of inventors following the Economic Census years to which the HHI
 refers.
 However, reverse causality could still be present if the autocorrelation
 of inventor shares is sufficiently high.
 As a consequence, I have calculated 2SLS estimates that instrument the
 change in the HHI lower bound with changes in product market restrictions,
 as measured by the Mercatus dataset RegData 4.0.
 Theoretically, an increase in restrictions should raise barriers to entry
 in affected product markets, thus leading to higher concentration.
 As discussed below, such proves to be the case empirically, validating
 sector-specific restrictions as an instrument for concentration.
 A violation of the exclusion restriction requires a causal connection between
 product market regulations and the share of inventors hired by each sector,
 independent of product market concentration.
 For example, regulations affecting existing technologies might require
 more inventors to meet product market restrictions.
 However, this effect is unlikely to be sufficiently large and persistent
 to be captured by my measure of inventor shares.
 Further, the regulations counted in RegData are not exclusively product
 restrictions, but also include reporting obligations and other legal burdens
 unrelated to technological components.
 In addition, while product restrictions might certainly induce a change
 in the direction of innovation, there is no a priori reason to believe
 that the scale of innovation activity should increase.
 These considerations lead me to believe that the exclusion restriction
 is not likely to be violated.

 These estimates are statistically indistinguishable from the ones reported
 in the baseline regression, and equally significant as highlighted by the
 Anderson-Rubin p-value and the corresponding confidence intervals in square
 brackets.
 The latter is the most appropriate measure of significant since the first-stage
 F clearly indicates that instruments are weak.
 This is unsurprising since, as detailed above, both the HHI lower bound
 and the regulation measures are estimated.
 In particular, I had to impute regulations for a large part of the sample
 using the cosine-similarity between product market restrictions.

While the findings presented so far establish a connection between inventor
 and product market concentration, they do not establish that changes in
 the distribution of researchers across sectors are inefficient.
 It would not be unreasonable, for example, to think that more concentrated
 sectors saw increased entry as a result of the higher rents captured by
 incumbents.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegStats"

\end_inset

 shows that the opposite occurred.
 Specifically, the share of effective inventors accruing to top inventor-hiring
 firms increased in the sectors that attracted more inventors over the period
 considered, relative to firms with fewer inventors in the sector.
 These outcomes suggest that inventors have increasingly concentrated among
 large incumbents, that is, sectors that increased their inventor share
 also saw a 
\emph on
within-sector
\emph default
 increase in inventor concentration.
 Throughout this section, I present results using changes in inventor shares
 to focus directly on the correlation between inventor transitions and their
 within-sector distribution.
 I verify that these findings are robust to using the change in the HHI,
 as should be expected from the strong correlation between these two variables
 reported above.
 Results obtained using this independent variable are available upon request.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My next finding suggests that inventor concentration is driven by a rise
 in defensive innovation, that is R&D aimed at protecting the incumbents'
 dominant position and raising barriers to entry.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 shows that inventors' concentration in specific sectors went hand in hand
 with a fall in forward citations for patents, a standard measure of a patent's
 contribution to further innovations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The result in Columns (1) and (2) report two different measures of forward

 As discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, computing the forward citation lag distribution conditioning on the technology
 class of the cited patent.
 Column (2) further conditions on the technology class of citing patents.
 Column (3) presents the estimates relative to patent generality, a measure
 of technological scope of application.
 Regressions are unweighted since they rely only on patent data, but results
 are robust to weighting by sales.
 I find a highly significant negative relation between changes in inventor
 shares and the fall in forward citations.
 A 1 percentage point increase in the share of inventors leads to a 0.2%
 reduction in forward citations.

 Using the coefficient in Column (2) of Table

 sectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.045\text{pp}$

 This implies a fall in average labor productivity implied by misallocation
 of 0.45pp.
 While these numbers might appear large considering the entirety of the
 economy, it is worth noting that my sample includes mainly manufacturing
 and retail sectors, which experienced a sizable reduction of 
\begin_inset Formula $2.73pp$
\end_inset

 in average annual productivity growth from 1997 to 2012, driven by a steep
 decline in output per worker growth in manufacturing.
 Therefore, the mechanism I propose would explain around 15 percent of the
 observed decrease in output per worker growth in these sectors.

 Using the estimates in Column (2), a median HHI change of 0.02 and a median
 number of effective inventors of 1421 in sectors with growth in inventor
 shares implies a

This last set of results further supports the hypothesis that defensive
 innovation increased in concentrating sectors.
 To protect their dominant position, firms engage in such R&D to thwart
 innovation by potential competitors, which manifests through an increase
 in patent enforcement cases and a reduction in inventors' productivity
 in sectors with increased concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Discussion of Alternative Channels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above analysis shows that inventors have accrued to sectors with increased
 concentration, primarily to incumbent firms, leading to an increase in
 litigation, a fall in inventors' productivity and forward citations.
 My interpretation of these empirical findings is that firms in high-concentrati
on sectors have increased their efforts in defensive innovation, meant to
 secure patents that can later be used to discourage further entry.
 However, other papers are also consistent with increased concentration
 of inventors within sectors and decreased R&D productivity.
 Two competing explanations stand out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first explanation may come from technological complexity in the spirit
 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bloomAreIdeasGetting2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While R&D might in general have become more difficult, my results do not
 show a decrease in patents per inventor in sectors with increased concentration.
 On the contrary, given that my inventor measure captures patent per capita,
 I effectively observe a relative increase in patenting activity in high-concent
ration sectors, excluding that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ideas getting harder to find
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 drive my results.
 Another explanation is increasing incremental, firm-specific R&D, as documented
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "akcigitSlowingBusinessDynamism2020,akcigitTenFactsDeclining2021"
literal "false"

 I verify that sectors with increased concentration did not see more self-citati
ons or falling patent generality, which are commonly used measures of the
 radical nature and applicability of patents.
