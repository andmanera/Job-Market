\begin_layout Standard
This section presents a Schumpeterian model based on

\end_inset

, featuring growth through creative destruction by entrants, as well as
 the possibility for incumbent monopolist of researching a defensive technology
 that increases research costs for entrants.
 I first present a single-sector model to clarify the mechanism at play
 within each sector in the economy and study a constant-growth equilibrium
 analytically.
 I then extend the model to two sectors, and I consider a fixed supply of
 inventors, which shuts down within-sector misallocation occurring independently
 of inventors' movements across sectors.
 I show that increasing markups in one of the sectors of the economy lead
 to a misallocation of inventors towards defensive innovation in the less
 competitive sector.
 Finally, I study the optimal allocation of R&D subsidies needed to achieve
 maximum growth in a calibration of the two-sector model that matches moments
 of the R&D distribution in 1997.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the following continuous time economy with a single final good,
 populated by a representative household with preferences over consumption
 and R&D labor 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}_{t}\int_{t}^{\infty}\exp\left(-\rho\left(s-t\right)\right)\left(\ln C_{s}-\frac{\chi\left(L_{s}^{RD}\right)^{1+\frac{1}{\varphi}}}{1+\frac{1}{\varphi}}\right)\mathrm{d}s,\label{eq:Utility}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is the Frisch labor supply.
 In addition, the representative household inelastically supplies 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 units of production labor.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While this assumption is not necessary for the results to hold, it simplifies
 the analysis considerably.
 In the following section, I will consider both production and research
 labor as given by a fixed endowment in the constant growth equilibrium
 of the economy.
 In that case, the assumption is equivalent to assuming that both labor
 endowments grow at a constant rate.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The representative household owns a differentiated portfolio of all the
 firms in the economy, with rate of return 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

, and receives a wages 
\begin_inset Formula $w,w^{RD},$
\end_inset

 for each unit of production and research labor, respectively.
 I assume that the economy is closed and that the final good is only used
 for consumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}=Y_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 This structure yields a standard Euler equation and R&D labor supply with
 Frisch elasticity 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The market structure in the model follows 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "acemogluIntellectualPropertyRights2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "abramsPatentValueCitations2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Accordingly, the consumption good in the economy, which I take as numeraire,
 is the unit-measure aggregate of products
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ln Y_{t}=\int_{0}^{1}\ln y_{t}(i)\mathrm{d}i.\label{eq:Y}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The market for each product 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}(i)$
\end_inset

 consists of an incumbent and a fringe of competitors.
 In what follows, I focus on a single market, dropping the argument 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Each firm 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 in the sector produces an undifferentiated good with the linear production
 technology:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{j,t}y_{j,t}=l_{j,t},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j,t}$
\end_inset

 denotes the labor requirement to produce a unit of output, and 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{j,t}$
\end_inset

 the production labor employed by the firm.
 Competitors have labor requirement 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{e,t}=c_{t}$
\end_inset

, while the incumbent faces a lower unit labor requirement 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{I,t}=\frac{c_{t}}{\phi}$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi>1$
\end_inset

.
 Profit maximization by the incumbent gives an optimum limit price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}=w_{t}c_{e,t}$
\end_inset

, which leads her to capture the entire market and act as a monopolist,
 charging a markup 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi>1$
\end_inset

 on the marginal cost.
 The Cobb-Douglas assumption on the final good implies equilibrium normalized
 profits,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\Pi_{t}}{Y_{t}}\equiv\pi=\left(\frac{\phi-1}{\phi}\right).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Innovation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Incumbents and entrants can conduct innovation activity that reduces their
 unit costs to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{I,t+\Delta_{t}}=\frac{c_{e,t}}{\left(1+\eta\right)\phi},\quad\eta>1
\]

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 parametrizes the percentage increase in productivity for the innovating
 firm, relative to the technology previously operated by the incumbent.
 Whenever either the incumbent or an entrant realize an innovation, all
 other firms gain access to a technology with unit costs, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{e,t+\Delta_{t}}=c_{e,t}/\left(1+\eta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 These assumptions imply that, if entrants realize an innovation, they outcompet
e previous incumbents and become the new monopolists.
 Displaced incumbents join the pool of entrants and from instant 
\begin_inset Formula $t+\Delta t$
\end_inset

 onwards operate the technology

This amounts to assuming that the incumbent's technology becomes obsolete
 after displacement or that incumbents scrap the assets needed to operate
 the innovative technology upon destruction.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 With this structure, the relative productivity of incumbents to entrants
 is fixed at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 regardless of the number of innovations realized, which allows a recursive
 formulation of the problem.
 I therefore drop time indexes in what follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Incumbents' and entrants' innovation differ in two respects.
 First, successful incumbents' R&D produces a 
\emph on
patent wall 
\emph default
of size 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega>1$
\end_inset

, which decreases the success probability of entrants' innovations.
 Second, successful entrants' R&D results in an implemented innovation with
 certainty, while incumbents adopt new technologies with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in[0,1].$
\end_inset

 I introduce this parameter to allow for incremental incumbents' innovations.
 The lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, the lower the expected productivity gains from incumbents' innovations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "acemogluIntellectualPropertyRights2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, innovation investments consist in the choice of an arrival rate of new
 discoveries 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{I}$
\end_inset

, and that R&D costs are increasing and convex in this arrival rate:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C\left(x_{I};w^{RD}\right)=\alpha_{I}\frac{x_{I}^{\gamma}}{\gamma}w^{RD},\ \gamma>1,
\]

\end_inset

where the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{I}\frac{x_{I}^{\gamma}}{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 indicates the amount of inventors that the incumbent needs to obtain innovation
s with a flow probability 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{I}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{RD}$
\end_inset

 is the wage paid to inventors.
 For simplicity, incumbents can only erect 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 patent wall of size 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega>1$
\end_inset

, and cannot invest in further innovation until their patent expires, which
 occurs at a rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under these assumptions, incumbents' values at any given instant are just
 a function of the state of the patent wall in the product market they operate,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega\in\left\{ 1,\omega\right\} $
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
rV(1)-\dot{V}(1) & =\max_{x_{I}}\left\{ \left(\frac{\phi-1}{\phi}\right)Y-\alpha_{I}\frac{x_{I}^{\gamma}}{\gamma}w^{RD}+x_{I}\left(V(\omega)-V(1)\right)-x_{e,1}V(1)\right\} ,\label{eq:v_1}\\
rV(\omega)-\dot{V}(\omega) & =\left(\frac{\phi-1}{\phi}\right)Y+\delta\left(V(1)-V(\omega)\right)-x_{e,\omega}V(\omega),\label{eq:v_om}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,\omega}$
\end_inset

 denote entrants' innovation intensities, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the interest rate in the economy, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 the rate of patent expiration.
 The first line displays the flow value to incumbents that operate in a
 market not protected by a patent wall.
 There, incumbents realize instantaneous profits

 and choose their innovation intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{I}$
\end_inset

, taking the researchers' wage 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{RD}$
\end_inset

 and the entrants' innovation intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,1}$
\end_inset

 as given.
 If entrants are successful at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,1}$
\end_inset

, incumbents are destroyed.
 If incumbents' innovation is successful at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{I}$
\end_inset

, they obtain the patent wall 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, which grants them the protected value 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\omega)$
\end_inset

.
 When a patent wall is in place, incumbents realize the same flow profits
 as in the unprotected state, due to the economy-wide spillovers described
 above.
 However, incumbents face a different entrants' innovation intensity, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,\omega}$
\end_inset

, which is in equilibrium lower than 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,1}$
\end_inset

 due to the patent wall in place.
 Incumbents face a flow probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 that the patent wall is exogenously destroyed, in which case they transition
 back to the unprotected state.
 The optimal incumbent's R&D decision reads
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x_{I}=\bm{1}\left\{ V(\omega)-V(1)>0\right\} \left(\frac{V(\omega)-V(1)}{\alpha_{I}w^{RD}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}.\label{eq:RD_I}
\end{equation}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "abramsPatentValueCitations2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I assume that each market has a mass of atomistic entrants, indexed by
 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, who face innovation costs that feature congestion externalities
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C\left(x_{e,\Omega,j};w^{RD}\right)=\zeta\Omega x_{e,\Omega,j}x_{e,\Omega}w^{RD}.
\]

\end_inset

In this specification, 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

 parametrizes the inventor requirement to obtain a unit aggregate entrants'
 innovation rate when the market is not protected by patent walls, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=1$
\end_inset

.
 Individuals costs are linear in the total entrants' research intensity
 in the product market, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,\Omega}\equiv\int_{\mathcal{J}}x_{e,\Omega,j}\mathrm{d}j.$
\end_inset

 In other terms, individual entry costs increase with the aggregate entry
 rate.
 Successful entrants obtain a new unprotected technology, regardless of
 the state of the market that they target.
 Free entry gives the entrants' innovation rate as a decreasing function
 of the market's patent wall,

Equilibrium with Constant Growth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mass of protected and unprotected markets evolve according to:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\dot{\mu}_{1} & =-\left(x_{I}+x_{e,1}\right)\mu_{1}+\delta\mu_{\omega}+x_{e,\omega}\mu_{e,\omega}+x_{e,1}\mu_{e,1},\label{eq: dist1-1}\\
\dot{\mu}_{\omega} & =-\left(x_{e,\omega}+\delta\right)\mu_{\omega}+x_{I}\mu_{1},\label{eq: dist2-1}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{e,\omega}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{e,1}$

 denote the mass of entrants targeting each markets.

\end_inset

.
 Similarly, the mass of entrants in each product market follows the laws
 of motion:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\dot{\mu}_{e,1} & =-\left(x_{e,1}+x_{I}\right)\mu_{e,1}+x_{e,1}\mu_{1}+\delta\mu_{e,\omega},\label{eq: dist3-1}\\

\end{align}

\end_inset

The model is closed by clearing production and R&D labor markets:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
L & =\int_{0}^{1}l(i)\mathrm{d}i,\label{eq: Lprod}\\
L^{RD} & =\zeta\left(\omega x_{e,\omega}\mu_{e,\omega}+x_{e,1}\mu_{e,1}\right)+\alpha_{I}\frac{x_{I}^{\gamma}}{\gamma}\mu_{1}.\label{eq: LRD}

The definition of the constant growth equilibrium and its properties follow.

In a previous version of this paper, I prove that a sufficient condition
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{e,\omega}^{\star}$
\end_inset

 to increase with markups is that the research intensity of incumbents is
 more elastic than entrants', a condition which is verified in all the numerical
 simulations I explored.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 As the following proposition shows, higher markups unambiguously increase
 research efforts by incumbents and entrants, as well as the share of R&D
 labor accruing to incumbents.

 markup

Higher markups raise the value of monopolistic positions, propelling entrants'

However, this finding is not sufficient to generate a fall in inventor productiv
ity.
 That is because the overall change in inventors' productivity can be decomposed
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{d}\left(\frac{g}{L^{RD}}\right) & =\mathrm{d}\left(\frac{L_{e}}{L^{RD}}P_{e}\right)+\mathrm{d}\left(\frac{L_{I}}{L^{RD}}P_{I}\right),

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{e}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{I}$
\end_inset

 denote entrants' and incumbents' productivity, respectively.
 As long as incumbents' productivity is lower than entrants, a reallocation
 of inventors towards dominant firm leads to a decrease in inventor productivity.
 However, this effect can in principle be offset by an increase in entrants'
 productivity.
 The sufficient conditions in Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 in the Appendix provides parametric sufficient conditions for the case
 with quadratic costs, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=2$
\end_inset

, which is analytically tractable.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In particular, if incumbents' research effort is more elastic than entrants',
 an increase in markups reduces the share of unprotected markets, making
 entry overall more difficult as well as reducing entrants' productivity.
 This reasoning also clarifies why the condition is sufficient.
 Indeed, a fall in inventors' productivity occurs as long as the increase
 in creative-destruction growth by entrants is not high enough relative
 to the increase in defensive innovation by entrants.
 As noted above, this condition is satisfied in the data and always appear
 to be in numerical simulations, regardless of specific assumptions on parameter
 values.
 In particular, the assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

 is not necessary to generate the result, but it gives clear analytical
 results in the proof to this proposition.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

Note also that when inventors' supply is inelastic, wage increases offset
 partial-equilibrium increase in labor demand, and the unique equilibrium
 implies a fixed allocation of inventors across incumbents and entrants.

 An increase in the markup raises profits, thereby increasing the value
 of dominant positions and propelling both incumbents' and entrants' research.
 Importantly, the incumbents' inventor demand is more elastic to increased
 profits, which raises the overall proportion of researchers employed in
 defensive projects.
 Although overall growth increases with higher aggregate R&D, the productivity
 of inventors falls, as they are allocated to incumbents.
 Two observations are in order.
 First, if inventors' supply is held fixed, the allocation across sectors
 does not change with markups, leaving R&D productivity unaffected.
 Similarly, without defensive innovation, the increase in profits only results
 in increased entry and growth, and unchanged inventors' productivity, since
 incumbents do not invest in R&D.

 & =\left(1+\frac{\left(\omega-1\right)-\omega z}{1+\omega z}\right)+\omega z\left(\frac{-\omega}{\left(1+\omega z\right)^{2}}\right)\\
 & =\left(\frac{\omega}{1+\omega z}\right)+\left(\frac{-\omega^{2}z}{\left(1+\omega z\right)^{2}}\right)\\

Clearly, increase in growth is a byproduct of the perfectly elastic supply
 of inventors, who get drawn into R&D by increased profits.
 It is apparent that the increased in growth is driven by the increase in
 entrants' R&D activity, while the decrease in inventor productivity is
 driven by the increase in the inventors' share hired by monopolists engaged
 in defensive innovation.

 I fix inventor supply, so that markups have no effect on inventors' productivit

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As discussed above, a rigid inventors' supply excludes reallocation of inventors
 within sectors in the absence of cross-sector mobility.
 When aggregate inventors' supply is elastic, increased markups produce
 more misallocation, since the allocation of inventors becomes less efficient
 both within and across sectors.

\begin_layout Standard
An increase in the markup of sector 2 leads to a pronounced reallocation
 of inventors away from sector 1.
 In sector 2, incoming inventors are allocated disproportionately to incumbents.
 Computing the Lerner Index on NBER-CES data as described in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 reveals that the markup gap between more and less concentrated sectors
 has increased by about 20% over the period of analysis.
 This implies a fall in inventors' productivity of 2.5% compared to the benchmark
 where the two sectors have the same competitive structure.
 This also results in a 
\begin_inset Formula $2.5\%$
\end_inset

 fall in GDP growth, about 0.075pp.
 This estimate is in between the lower bound of 0.13pp implied by my estimates
 in the lower panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegProd"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 and the lower bound of .03pp implied by the upper panel.
 As discussed in previous sections, a rigid R&D labor supply shuts down
 inventor misallocation unrelated to sectoral shifts, so this calibration
 understates the productivity effects of increased concentration.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 also shows that inventors within sector 1 reallocate toward entrants, as
 lower entry in this sector reduces the incentives for defensive innovation.
 Therefore, while the movements of inventors from sector 1 to sector 2 are
 overall detrimental to growth, they are not for R&D productivity in sector
 1.
 However, overall growth is lower since less R&D resources are available
 to this sector in equilibrium.
 Thus, reallocation away from competitive sectors has both costs–a reduction
 in sectoral growth–and benefits, coming from a more efficient distribution
 of resources within the sector.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This comparative static exercise also clarifies how defensive innovation
 undergirds misallocation across sectors.
 In the absence of defensive innovation, inventors just reallocate across
 sectors, leaving productivity and growth unaffected.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Growth-Maximizing Policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I now turn to calculating the combination of R&D subsidies that maximizes
 growth.
 In this model, banning defensive innovation leads to a first-best where
 only entrants conduct R&D and reallocation does not hamper growth.
 However, such a ban might be impossible to implement, as determining the
 nature of patents ex-ante might in practice be unfeasible.
 For this reason, I assume that the planner cannot distinguish productive
 from unproductive projects, and can only employ using tax instruments.

I start from the 2012 equilibrium of my model economy, where the gap in
 markups between sectors is 20%, and all firms receive a 
\begin_inset Formula $19\%$
\end_inset

 subsidy to inventors' wages and incur a 23% tax on profits.
 I study three cost-neutral alternatives, where I constrain the planner
 to leave the expenditure on R&D subsidies as a percentage of GDP fixed
 at the 2012 benchmark.
 In the first scenario, the planner is allowed to distribute subsidies freely
 and can condition the allocation on both the sector and the identity of
 the receiving firm (entrant or incumbent).
 In the other two scenarios, I only allow the planner to act on one of these
 dimensions at a time.
 That is, the planner can either control the distribution of funds across
 sectors, but not between incumbents and entrants, or vice versa.

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 presents the results of this exercise.
 The 2012 equilibrium is reported in Columns 1 and 2.
 For reference, the 1997 calibrated model has two identical sectors, which
 share the stock of inventors equally.
 Within each sector incumbents have 30.3% of the overall inventors employed,
 and GDP growth is 3% per annum.
 In the 2012 baseline, the distribution of inventors is tilted toward the
 second sector, where markups have increased.
 This results in a fall in annual GDP growth of .07pp, about 2.5% of the 1997
 benchmark.
 As shown in the graphs above, this new equilibrium sees a larger share
 of inventors allocated to incumbents in the second sector, which increases
 its growth relative to sector 1.
 However, productivity declines because incumbents conduct more defensive
 innovation.
 Columns 3 and 4 report the optimal cost-neutral R&D subsidies chosen by
 a growth-maximizing planner.
 Somewhat surprisingly, the most efficient allocation of funds is a subsidy
 to entrants in the more concentrated sector only.
 Indeed, defensive innovation is inefficient because it makes entrants'
 R&D less productive.
 This is the main friction that the growth-maximizing planner wishes to
 remove.
 As discussed above, the outflow of inventors from sector 1 increases inventor
 productivity, as lower R&D by entrants depresses defensive innovation by
 incumbents.
 It is therefore undesirable to reallocate inventors to entrants in sector
 1, where barriers to entry are now naturally lower.
 Conversely, the optimal policy acts directly on the higher barriers now
 present in sector 2, subsidizing inventors' wages for entrants.
 Consistent with this argument, growth is not maximized when the planner
 allocates R&D subsidies to a single sector, without condition on the identity
 of the firm.
 This scenario is reported in columns 5 and 6.
 The planner subsidizes the more competitive sector 1, which brings annual
 growth up to 2.99%, recovering most of the lost ground relative to the 1997
 benchmark.
 However, subsidies now make defensive innovation cheaper for incumbents,
 as well as more attractive due to increased entry.
 If a sector-specific subsidy to entrants is politically unfeasible, a viable,
 effective alternative is a blanket entry subsidy as reported in Columns
 7 and 8, which raises growth to 3.38%.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This policy analysis suggests that entry subsidies are the most effective
 policy to counter the friction introduced by defensive innovation in this
 model economy.
 In less competitive sectors, where this friction is most pronounced, R&D
 entry subsidies increase growth by 0.5pp per annum.
 A more feasible uniform R&D subsidy to entrants in both sectors produces
 similar effects.
 Conversely, sector-specific subsidies to reallocate inventors to the competitiv
e sector are less effective, since they subsidize incumbents' pre-emptive
 innovation, exacerbating the inefficiency that the planner wishes to contrast.
