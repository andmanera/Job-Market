\begin_layout Abstract
\paragraph_spacing single
The rapid productivity gains achieved by technological innovations in the
 
\begin_inset Formula $20^{\text{th}}$
\end_inset

 century have slowed in recent decades.
 This has come at a time of increased market concentration.
 In this paper, I explore how dominant companies in concentrated sectors
 have siphoned off inventors that might have been employed more productively
 in competitive industries.
 For the period 1997-2012, I establish that sectors with rising concentration
 captured a disproportionate share of researchers, while also experiencing
 a decrease in R&D productivity, signaled by falling forward citations and
 slowing growth per inventor.
 These findings imply that inventors became increasingly misallocated, accountin
g for nearly 30 percent of the decline in output per worker growth over
 the period.
 I show that these results arise naturally in a Schumpeterian growth model
 where monopolistic firms conduct “defensive patenting” to hamper competitors’
 R&D.
 A calibration of this model reveals that a growth-maximizing planner should
 subsidize entrants' R&D in high-concentration sectors.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Research and Development activities, which are key to innovation and growth,
 have generated increasingly smaller gains in productivity over the last
 few decades 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 A prominent explanation: Technological complexity is making it harder to
 come up with new ideas.
 A less explored alternative is misallocation of R&D resources 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "acemogluInnovationReallocationGrowth2018a,acemogluBottlenecksSectoralImbalances2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, a concern that is echoed in policy circles and the press 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "metzTechGiantsAre2017,bassBigTechSwallows2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 At issue, for example, is whether dominant high-tech firms are attracting
 a disproportionate share of highly educated, highly skilled workers at
 the expense of companies in more competitive sectors.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "talentseer2020AITalent2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, 20% of total Artificial Intelligence experts are employed by just five
 big-tech companies: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and IBM.
 At the same time, smaller firms in other sectors appear unable to attract
 this scarce talent.
 Two natural questions then arise: Is such allocation inefficient? And if
 so, can inventor misallocation explain the observed fall in R&D productivity?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer these questions, I study the broader effect of increasing market
 concentration on the allocation of inventors across sectors.
 I start by documenting several novel facts using US Patent and Trademark
 Office (USPTO) data and concentration measures from the Economic Census
 over the period 1997-2012.
 First, I show a positive correlation between increases in a sector's market
 concentration and the share of inventors it attracts.
 This correlation might indicate either that firms in high-concentration
 sectors have drawn more inventors or that they owe their success to large
 investment in research.
 To address this reverse causality problem, I adopt an instrumental variable
 strategy.
 I use the increase in the number of product-market regulations from Mercatus
 RegData as an instrument for increased concentration.
 This specification shows that sectors with increased concentration have
 increased their share of inventors and not vice versa.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two additional findings substantiate that high-concentration sectors are
 using R&D resources inefficiently and consequently depressing aggregate
 research productivity.
 First, the quality of patents in sectors with increased concentration declined,
 as measured by patent forward citations.
 Second, research productivity, as measured as growth in output per worker
 per inventor, has decreased in these sectors.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This measure of inventor productivity mirrors the analogous definition of
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

research productivity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 offered by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In the introduction to their paper, they decompose economic growth into
 the product of the number of researchers and a term capturing research
 productivity.
 Following this definition, I compute inventors' productivity as the ratio
 of the growth in each sector, which I measure using output per worker growth,
 and the number of inventors employed by that sector.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Further, I find that dominant firms draw a disproportionate share of their
 sector's inventors.
 Based on these three observations, I conclude that incumbent firms are
 focusing their research efforts on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

defensive innovation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that is, projects with the primary aim of warding off potential competition.
 I provide suggestive evidence for this mechanism for the period 2002-2012,
 where I document a strong correlation between increases in sectors' inventor
 shares and patent litigation cases.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I have to restrict the analysis to 2002-2012 since the USPTO Patent Number
 and Case Code File Dataset 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schwartzUSPTOPatentNumber2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 only provides data on patent litigation for the period 2003-2016.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Quantitatively, the midpoint of my estimates implies that inventor misallocatio
n is responsible for a 0.78pp fall in the average annual growth in output-per-wor
ker growth in the study sample.
 That translates to 27.3% of the observed decline over the period 1997-2012.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Methodologically, my analysis relies on a novel dataset of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowledge markets,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 defined as sets of product markets that share similar inventors.
 These markets are based on the network of inventor transitions across product
 categories, identified using USPTO patents classified by their NAICS sectors
 of application.
 This approach avoids pooling inventors with unrelated technical expertise,
 which would bias the response of inventor mobility to sectoral characteristics
 toward zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second part of the paper, I develop a model of R&D resource allocation.
 My objectives are twofold.
 First, I use the model to explain how inefficient defensive innovations
 can arise and proliferate as concentration increases.
 Second, I quantify the R&D productivity effects of increasing concentration
 and evaluate how R&D subsidies can be best allocated in the presence of
 defensive innovation.
 I adopt a Schumpeterian creative-destruction framework in which new entrants
 conduct productive R&D while incumbents employ inventors in defensive projects.
 A two-sector general equilibrium model shows that unbalanced changes in
 concentration across sectors generate a fall in inventor productivity and
 growth.
 Indeed, inventors shift to less competitive markets, where defensive projects,
 which hamper entry and Schumpeterian growth, are more prevalent, and away
 from competitive sectors where their efforts would be more productive.
 The theoretical analysis shows that defensive innovation is the key factor
 behind increased concentration of inventors among incumbents and the fall
 in R&D productivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I calibrate a two-sector version of my model to match moments of the R&D
 spending distribution in 1997 and growth over the period 1997-2012.
 This calibration produces a 2.5% fall in output per worker growth from misalloca
tion, close to the 3% lower bound implied by my estimates.
 I employ this model to study the allocation of cost-neutral R&D subsidies
 that maximize growth.
 The model suggests that subsidizing entrants' R&D in more concentrated
 sectors constitutes the most effective policy, leading to a rise in annual
 GDP growth of about 0.5pp (a 17% increase from the 2012 benchmark).
 An R&D subsidy for entrants in both markets produces similar effects.
 This finding resonates with the fact that defensive innovation is the main
 inefficiency in the model.
 Since this friction acts through increased entry barriers, the best way
 to counter it is to lower entry costs.
\end_layout

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.
 In the following section, I survey the related literature and place my
 study in its context.

\begin_layout Subsection
Related Literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My work builds on three main strands of the innovation literature: empirical
 studies on the effect of competition on innovation; papers on the allocation
 of R&D and the fall in research productivity; and empirical and theoretical
 studies of pre-emptive innovation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first strand, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "aghionCompetitionInnovationInvertedU2005a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 found that innovation increased at low levels of competition and decreased
 at high levels, depicting the relationship as an inverted U.
 Accordingly, this literature has highlighted contrasting effects of competition
 on R&D activity, focusing mostly on episodes of trade liberalization 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after " for an extensive review"
before "see"
key "shuImpactTradeLiberalization2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Most papers in this strand identify these effects at the firm-level, which
 restricts their scope to the effect of competition within product markets.
 My paper instead adopts a cross-sector view, analyzing the extent to which
 decreased competition in one market draws away resources from other markets.
 To do so, I build a novel dataset of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowledge markets,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sets of product markets that share the same inventors.
 While several papers investigate the mobility of inventors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "see,  e.g., "
key "azoulayMobilityEliteLife2017,morettiEffectStateTaxes2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I believe mine to be the first to analyze the effects of market structure
 on the cross-sector allocation of inventors.
\end_layout

With its focus on competition and innovation, my paper connects to literatures
 that document increased concentration

key "acemogluInnovationReallocationGrowth2018a,acemogluBottlenecksSectoralImbalances2021,akcigitGrowthHeterogeneousInnovations2018"

\end_inset

.
 My contribution bridges these literatures, explicitly linking changes in
 the competitive structure to the allocation of R&D resources across more
 and less concentrated sectors, and their deployment to productive or defensive
 projects.
 My findings suggest that increased defensive innovation is a relevant driver
 of lowered R&D productivity, which acts independently of other channels
 proposed in the literature, such as incremental innovation and lowered
 knowledge diffusion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "akcigitTenFactsDeclining2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and increased technological complexity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bloomAreIdeasGetting2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Indeed, I find no evidence that increased inventor concentration is correlated
 with incremental innovation or decreased patenting per inventor.
 Finally, the results in my paper consistent with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "vaziriAntitrustLawBusiness2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, who shows that stricter antitrust enforcement reduces R&D investments,
 while increasing productivity and firm entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several papers document the role of pre-emptive innovation in ordinary firm
 operations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after " for a review of the evidence"

 Most recently, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 show that, within product markets, large firms tend to account for the
 bulk of patenting activity, but are responsible for a smaller share of
 implemented innovations relative to non-patenting firms.
 The authors interpret this finding as evidence of defensive innovation,
 intended to deter competition.
 My paper builds on this literature showing that increased concentration
 raises the incentives for defensive innovation, as demonstrated by a fall
 in forward citations in concentrating sectors.
 This result connects to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "abramsPatentValueCitations2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, who study the cross-sectional relation between patent value and forward
 citations theoretically, showing that high-value patents also tend to receive
 fewer citations, and rationalize this finding through pre-emptive innovation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a theoretical standpoint, I embed defensive patenting as modeled in in

 into a Schumpeterian growth model, building on the extensive literature

 My solution relies on several results derived by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 To the best of my knowledge, my paper is the first to analyze the impact
 of defensive innovation in the context of a general-equilibrium growth
 model.
 The closest precedent to this analysis is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "joDefensiveInnovationFirm2019"

, where defensive innovation consists of a refinement of existing product
 lines, which increases the technological distance of incumbents from entrants
 in the tradition of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 By contrast, in my framework defensive innovation is specifically aimed
 at protecting dominant positions and reducing entry as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "abramsPatentValueCitations2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 I extend their model to consider the effects of defensive innovation on
 R&D productivity and overall innovation.
 My final contribution consists in analyzing the growth-maximizing allocation
 of R&D subsidies, which has not been previously studied in this context.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, I propose and document a novel explanation for the observed
 decline in growth and R&D productivity over the last few decades.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My empirical results show that increasing misallocation of inventors across
 different product markets accounts for up to 28% of the decline in output
 per worker growth in the sectors I analyze.
 This misallocation stems from uneven increases in concentration across
 product markets that are accompanied by a larger share of inventors accruing
 to less competitive sectors.
 I interpret my findings as resulting from an increase in defensive innovation
 in concentrated sectors.
 Such R&D activities are conducted primarily to block further entry and
 are reflected in a decline in patents’ forward citations, a larger share
 of inventors employed by incumbents, and rising patent enforcement cases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I study defensive innovation in a model of creative destruction, where incumbent
s can innovate to raise entrants’ costs.
 I calibrate two-sector version of the model to study the growth-maximizing
 allocation of R&D subsidies across sectors, as well as between incumbents
 and entrants.
 My analysis suggests that R&D subsidies to entrants are the most effective
 policy, directly tackling the friction generated by defensive innovation
 and potentially increasing growth by 17% of my baseline (0.5pp in absolute
 terms).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two main directions for future research stand out.
 The first would be to investigate the validity of my findings in an internation
al context, given that results in the literature of competition and innovation
 depend strongly on the country and the period analyzed.
 The second would be to conduct a thorough investigation of the evolution,
 causes, and consequences of pre-emptive innovation.
