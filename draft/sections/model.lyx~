\begin_layout Standard
This section presents a Schumpeterian model based on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, featuring growth through creative destruction by entrants, as well as
 the possibility for incumbent monopolist of researching a defensive technology
 that increases research costs for entrants.
 I first present a single-sector model to clarify the mechanism at play
 within each sector in the economy and study the properties of a constant-growth
 equilibrium analytically.
 I derive sufficient conditions under which markup increases lower R&D productiv
ity, and show that this occur only if the distribution of inventors shifts
 in favor of incumbent firms carrying out defensive innovation.

In the empirical analysis, I used the HHI as a measure of concentration
 and market power.
 Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:Using-the-Lerner"

\end_inset

 shows that the Lerner Index from NBER-CES, a standard measure of markups,
 is strongly correlated with the HHI in my sample, justifying the reduced-form
 mapping I adopt in this section.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 I also show that in this model, when the supply of inventors is rigid,
 inventors' productivity is unaffected by markup changes.
 Then, I move to consider a two-sector model, where each sector is identical
 to the single-sector model, and the supply of inventors is perfectly rigid,
 which shuts down within-sector misallocation occurring independently of
 inventors' movements across sectors.
 I show that increasing markups in one of the two sectors of the economy
 lead to a misallocation of R&D resources towards defensive innovation in
 the less competitive sector.
 Finally, I study the optimal allocation of R&D subsidies needed to achieve
 maximum growth in a calibration of the two-sector model that matches moments
 of the R&D distribution in 1997, the starting year for my empirical analysis.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the following continuous time economy with a single final good.
 There is a representative household with King-Plosser-Rebelo preferences
 over consumption and R&D labor 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}_{t}\int_{t}^{\infty}\exp\left(-\rho\left(s-t\right)\right)\left(\ln C_{s}-\frac{\chi\left(L_{s}^{RD}\right)^{1+\frac{1}{\phi}}}{1+\frac{1}{\phi}}\right)\mathrm{d}s,\label{eq:Utility}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is the Frisch labor supply.
 In addition, the representative household inelastically supplies 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 units of production labor.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While this assumption is not necessary for the results to hold, it simplifies
 the analysis considerably.
 In the following section, I will consider both production and research
 labor as given by a fixed endowment in the constant growth equilibrium
 of the economy.
 In that case, the assumption is equivalent to assuming that both labor
 endowments grow at a constant rate.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The representative household owns a differentiated portfolio of all the
 firms in the economy, with rate of return 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

, and receives a wages 
\begin_inset Formula $w,w^{RD},$
\end_inset

 for each unit of production and research labor, respectively.
 I assume that the economy is closed and that the final good is only used
 for consumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{t}=Y_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The above utility function yields the Euler equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\dot{C_{t}}}{C_{t}}=r_{t}-\rho.
\]

\end_inset

It also yields the R&D labor supply
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L_{t}^{RD}=\left(\frac{w_{t}^{RD}}{\chi C_{t}}\right)^{\phi}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption good in the economy in each instant is a Cobb-Douglas aggregate
 of a measure-one continuum of products
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ln Y_{t}=\int_{0}^{1}\ln y_{t}(i)\mathrm{d}i.\label{eq:Y}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The consumption good in the economy is taken as the numeraire.
 The market for each product 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}(i)$
\end_inset

 consists of an incumbent and a fringe of competitors.
 In what follows, I focus on a single market, dropping the argument 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Each agent 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 in the sector has the linear production technology:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{j,t}=c_{j,t}l_{j,t},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j,t}$
\end_inset

 denotes the labor requirement for agent 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 to produce a unit of output, and 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{j,t}$
\end_inset

 denotes the production labor employed by the firm.
 The incumbent and competitors produce undifferentiated goods, and differ
 in their labor requirement.
 Competitors have labor requirement 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{e,t}=c_{t}$
\end_inset

, while the incumbent faces a lower unit labor requirement 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{I,t}=\frac{c_{t}}{\phi}$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi>1$
\end_inset

.
 The incumbent maximizes profits by choosing a price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}$
\end_inset

 for her product.
 Profit maximization gives an optimum limit price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}=w_{t}c_{t}$
\end_inset

, which leads her to capture the entire market and realize profits
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Pi_{t}=\left(c_{e,t}-c_{I,t}\right)w_{t}y_{t}=\left(\frac{\phi-1}{\phi}\right)c_{t}w_{t}y_{t}.
\]

\end_inset

Therefore, the incumbent acts as a monopolist, charging a markup 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi>1$
\end_inset

 on its marginal cost.
 By the Cobb-Douglas assumption on the final good, the demand facing each
 product line is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\frac{Y_{t}}{p_{t}}=\frac{Y_{t}}{w_{t}c_{t}}.
\]

\end_inset

Therefore, equilibrium normalized profits read
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\Pi_{t}}{Y_{t}}\equiv\pi=\left(\frac{\phi-1}{\phi}\right).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Innovation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both incumbents and entrants can conduct innovation activity that, if successful
, reduces their unit costs to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{I,t+\Delta_{t}}=\frac{c_{e,t}}{\left(1+\eta\right)\phi},\quad\eta>1
\]

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 parametrizes the percentage increase in productivity for the innovating
 firm, relative to the technology previously operated by the incumbent.
 I assume spillovers from realized innovations as follows.
 Whenever either the incumbent or an entrant realize an innovation, all
 other firms gain access to a technology with unit costs
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{e,t+\Delta_{t}}=\frac{c_{e,t}}{\left(1+\eta\right)}.
\]

\end_inset

These assumptions imply that, if entrants realize an innovation, they outcompete
 previous incumbents and become the new monopolists.
 Displaced incumbents join the pool of entrants and from instant 
\begin_inset Formula $t+\Delta t$
\end_inset

 onwards operate the technology

\begin_inset Formula $c_{e,t+\Delta_{t}}$
\end_inset

.
 This amounts to assuming that the incumbent's technology becomes obsolete
 after displacement.

An alternative interpretation of this assumption is that incumbents are
 forced to scrap the assets needed to operate the innovative technology
 upon destruction, so that the technology is no longer available to them
 onwards.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Technically, this innovation structure removes the need to keep track of
 the number of realized innovations.
 Indeed, in each product market the relative productivity of incumbents
 relative to entrants is fixed at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, making it possible to formulate the choice of innovation as a recursive
 problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Incumbents' and entrants' innovation differ in two respects.
 First, successful incumbents' R&D produces a 
\emph on
patent wall 
\emph default
of size 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega>1$
\end_inset

, which decreases the success probability of entrants' innovations.
 Second, successful entrants' R&D results in an implemented innovation with
 certainty, while incumbents adopt new technologies with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in[0,1].$
\end_inset

 This parameter can be interpreted in two ways.
 The first interpretation is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 captures the probability that the newly discovered technology is compatible
 with the incumbents' current production techniques.
 The second interpretation is related to the radical nature of incumbents'
 innovations.
 A low value for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 reduces the expected productivity improvement from an innovation by the
 incumbent.
 In other words, the lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda,$
\end_inset

 the more incremental are incumbents' innovations.
 Under these assumptions, incumbents 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 obtain a patent wall, but they only implement their innovations with probabilit
y 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.

This specification connects to the empirical evidence in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, who show that large incumbent firms tend to produce many patents, but
 implement a small number of product innovations.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "acemogluIntellectualPropertyRights2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I assume that innovation investments consist in the choice of an arrival
 rate of new discoveries 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{I}$
\end_inset

, and that R&D costs are increasing and convex in this arrival rate.
 I specify incumbents' R&D costs as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C\left(x_{I};w^{RD}\right)=\alpha_{I}\frac{x_{I}^{\gamma}}{\gamma}w^{RD},\ \gamma>1,
\]

\end_inset

where the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{I}\frac{x_{I}^{\gamma}}{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 indicates the amount of inventors that the incumbent needs to obtain innovation
s with a flow probability 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{I}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{RD}$
\end_inset

 is the wage paid to inventors.
 For simplicity, I assume that incumbents can only have one available innovation
 at a time.
 That is, incumbents can only erect 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 patent wall of size 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega>1$
\end_inset

, and cannot invest in further innovation until this wall is destroyed at
 a rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

, which captures the pace of patent expiration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under these assumptions, incumbents' values at any given instant are just
 a function of the state of the patent wall in the product market they operate,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega\in\left\{ 1,\omega\right\} .$
\end_inset

 Given the recursive nature of the problem, I drop time indexes in what
 follows.
 Incumbents' value functions read:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
rV(1)-\dot{V}(1) & =\max_{x_{I}}\left\{ \left(\frac{\phi-1}{\phi}\right)Y-\alpha_{I}\frac{x_{I}^{\gamma}}{\gamma}w^{RD}+x_{I}\left(V(\omega)-V(1)\right)-x_{e,1}V(1)\right\} ,\label{eq:v_1}\\
rV(\omega)-\dot{V}(\omega) & =\left(\frac{\phi-1}{\phi}\right)Y+\delta\left(V(1)-V(\omega)\right)-x_{e,\omega}V(\omega),\label{eq:v_om}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,\omega}$
\end_inset

 denote entrants' innovation intensities, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the interest rate in the economy to be determined in equilibrium, and
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 the rate of patent expiration.
 The first line displays the flow value to incumbents that operate in a
 market not protected by a patent wall.
 There, incumbents realize instantaneous profits

, taking the researchers' wage 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{RD}$
\end_inset

 and the entrants' innovation intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,1}$
\end_inset

 as given.
 If entrants are successful at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,1}$
\end_inset

, incumbents are destroyed.
 If incumbents' innovation is successful at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{I}$
\end_inset

, they obtain the patent wall 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, which grants them the protected value 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\omega)$
\end_inset

.
 When a patent wall is in place, incumbents realize the same flow of profits
 as in the unprotected state, since economy-wide spillovers imply that incumbent
s are unable to reap profits from implemented innovations.
 However, incumbents face a different entrants' innovation intensity, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,\omega}$
\end_inset

, which is lower than 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,1}$
\end_inset

 due to the patent wall in place, as I will show below.
 Finally, incumbents in state 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 face a flow probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 that the patent wall is exogenously destroyed, in which case they transition
 back to the unprotected state.
 Under these assumptions, the optimal incumbent's R&D decision is given
 by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x_{I}=\bm{1}\left\{ V(\omega)-V(1)>0\right\} \left(\frac{V(\omega)-V(1)}{\alpha_{I}w^{RD}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}.\label{eq:RD_I}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "abramsPatentValueCitations2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I assume that each market has a mass of atomistic entrants, indexed by
 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, who face innovation costs that feature congestion externalities
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C\left(x_{e,\Omega,j};w^{RD}\right)=\zeta\Omega x_{e,\Omega,j}x_{e,\Omega}w^{RD}.
\]

\end_inset

In this specification, 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

 parametrizes the inventor requirement to obtain a unit aggregate entrants'
 innovation rate when the market is not protected by patent walls, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=1$
\end_inset

.
 Individuals costs are linear in the total entrants' research intensity
 in the product market, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,\Omega}\equiv\int_{\mathcal{J}}x_{e,\Omega,j}\mathrm{d}j.$
\end_inset

 In other terms, individual entry costs increase with the aggregate entry
 rate.
 Successful entrants obtain a new unprotected technology, regardless of
 the state of the market that they target, based on the assumption that
 they do not rely on patents from previous incumbents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the above assumptions, the free entry condition for entrants targeting
 a market with patent wall 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 reads
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\max_{x_{e,\Omega,i}}\left\{ x_{e,\Omega,i}V(1)-\zeta\Omega x_{e,\Omega,i}x_{e,\Omega}w^{RD}\right\} .
\]

\end_inset

This condition pins down the entry rate for each product market with patent
 wall 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x_{e,\Omega}=\frac{V(1)}{\zeta\Omega w^{RD}},\quad\Omega\in\{1,\omega\}.\label{eq:RD_e}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This expression clarifies the effect of defensive innovation in this model.
 The size of the patent wall 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 represents the factor decrease in the entry rate when a defensive innovation
 is successful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Equilibrium with Constant Growth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The laws of motion of product markets across protected and unprotected states
 is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\dot{\mu}_{1} & =-\left(x_{I}+x_{e,1}\right)\mu_{1}+\delta\mu_{\omega}+x_{e,\omega}\mu_{e,\omega}+x_{e,1}\mu_{e,1},\label{eq: dist1-1}\\
\dot{\mu}_{\omega} & =-\left(x_{e,\omega}+\delta\right)\mu_{\omega}+x_{I}\mu_{1},\label{eq: dist2-1}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{e,\omega}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{e,1}$
\end_inset

 denote the mass of entrants targeting protected and unprotected markets,
 respectively.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq: dist1-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 states that the mass of unprotected products decreases when incumbents
 successfully develop an innovation at flow probability, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{I},$
\end_inset

 or entrants displace existing incumbents at rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,1}$
\end_inset

.
 Products instead become unprotected if existing patent walls depreciate,
 or successful entrants become new monopolists.
 Conversely, Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq: dist1-2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that protected markets loose mass whenever entrants displace existing
 protected incumbents or defensive patents depreciate, and gain mass when
 incumbents in unprotected markets develop defensive innovations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mass of entrants in the two types of product markets is determined in
 equilibrium following the laws of motion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\dot{\mu}_{e,1} & =-\left(x_{e,1}+x_{I}\right)\mu_{e,1}+x_{e,1}\mu_{1}+\delta\mu_{e,\omega},\label{eq: dist3-1}\\
\dot{\mu}_{e,\omega} & =-\left(x_{e,\omega}+\delta\right)\mu_{e,\omega}+x_{e,\omega}\mu_{\omega}+x_{I}\mu_{e,1}.\label{eq: dist4-1}
\end{align}

\end_inset

Here, the first line states that the pool of entrants in unprotected markets
 contracts if entrants develop innovations at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,1},$
\end_inset

 or incumbents make markets protected at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{I}.$
\end_inset

 The pool of entrants in markets with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=1$
\end_inset

 instead grows when incumbents get displaced by successful entrants and
 rejoin the ranks of outsiders, or previously protected markets loose their
 defensive walls.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 is obtained analogously.
 Given research intensities, clearing in the labor markets for production

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}

The expression for inventors' productivity can be used to obtain a first
 intuition of the mechanism through which higher markups lead to decreased
 productivity in this model.
 First, note that a unit of total entrants' research intensity in either
 protected and unprotected markets produces the same growth.
 Indeed, by the expression for growth, it is clear that a unit increase
 in either 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,\omega}^{\star}\mu_{e,\omega}^{\star}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,1}^{\star}\mu_{e,1}^{\star}$
\end_inset

 gives a growth of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

.
 However, the unit labor requirement of research intensity in protected
 markets is larger than in unprotected markets as a result of defensive
 patents.
 This is evident from the first term at the denominator, which shows that
 a unit of total research in protected markets requires 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta\omega$
\end_inset

 inventors, compared with just 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

 in unprotected markets.
 These facts immediately imply that any force that pushes entrants toward
 protected markets will lower their inventor productivity.
 One such force is an increase in incumbents' research intensity that outstrips
 entrants', which acts to increase 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{e,\omega},$
\end_inset

 the mass of entrants active in protected markets.
 As I show formally below, an increase in the markup raises the value of
 monopolistic positions, which pushes up both incumbents' and entrants'
 research intensities 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{I}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,\omega}.$

The following proposition states the main result in this section: Higher
 markups unambiguously increase research efforts by incumbents and entrants,
 as well as the share of R&D labor accruing to incumbents.
 The proposition also states the main condition for this result to lead
 to a fall in overall inventors' productivity in terms of sufficient statistics.
 In particular, the incumbents' R&D elasticity to markups must be larger
 than entrants'.
 This condition is satisfied in the data, as the estimates in Table

\begin_layout Standard
The intuition behind this proposition is that higher markups raise the value
 of monopolistic positions, thus raising both entrants' and incumbents'
 research effort.
 In addition, this leads to an overall increase in inventors employed by
 incumbents.
 Importantly, this holds only if defensive R&D is effective, showing the
 importance of this channel to reproduce the empirical findings in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegStats"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, this finding is not sufficient to generate a fall in inventor
 productivity.
 That is because the overall change in inventors' productivity can be decomposed
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{d}\left(\frac{g}{L^{RD}}\right) & =\mathrm{d}\left(\frac{L_{e}}{L^{RD}}P_{e}\right)+\mathrm{d}\left(\frac{L_{I}}{L^{RD}}P_{I}\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{e}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{I}$
\end_inset

 denote entrants' and incumbents' productivity, respectively.
 As long as incumbents' productivity is lower than entrants, a reallocation
 of inventors towards dominant firm leads to a decrease in inventor productivity.
 However, this effect can in principle be offset by an increase in entrants'
 productivity.
 The sufficient conditions in Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 ensure that this is not the case.

 in the Appendix provides parametric sufficient conditions for the case
 with quadratic costs, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=2$
\end_inset

, which is analytically tractable.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In particular, if incumbents' research effort is more elastic than entrants',
 an increase in markups reduces the overall share of unprotected markets,
 making entry overall more difficult as well as reducing entrants' productivity.
 This reasoning also clarifies why the condition is sufficient.
 Indeed, a fall in inventors' productivity occurs as long as the increase
 in creative-destruction growth by entrants is not high enough relative
 to the increase in defensive innovation by entrants.
 As noted above, this condition is satisfied in the data and always appear
 to be in numerical simulations, regardless of specific assumptions on parameter
 values.
 In particular, the assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

 is not necessary to generate the result, but it gives clear analytical
 results in the proof to this proposition.

 inventor labor demand is increasing in markups.
 As a result, when inventors' supply is fully rigid, wage effects need to
 fully offset the increase in labor demand, and by the uniqueness of the
 CGE, the allocation of inventors across incumbents and entrants is fixed.
 Indeed, aggregate labor demand is uniquely pinned down by research intensities
 through the stationary distribution.

 An increase in the markup raises profits, thereby increasing the value
 of dominant positions and propelling both incumbents' and entrants' research.
 Importantly, the incumbents' inventor demand is more elastic to increased
 profits, which raises the overall proportion of researchers employed in
 defensive projects.
 Although overall growth increases with higher aggregate R&D, the productivity
 of inventors falls, as they are allocated to incumbents.
 Two observations are in order.
 First, with a fixed supply of inventors, equilibrium allocations do not
 change with increased profits, leaving R&D productivity unaffected.
 Second, in the absence of defensive innovation, the increase in profits
 would only result in increased entry and growth, leaving productivity constant.

 It is apparent that the increased in growth is driven by the increase in

 driven by the increase in the inventors' share hired by monopolists engaged

 I choose the lower bound of these estimates to minimize the asymmetry of
 innovation costs between incumbents and entrants, as more convex incumbents'
 costs mechanically make their research less effective than entrants.
 The rate of patent expiration comes directly from the legislative framework
 in the US, as established by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 measures how radical are incumbents' innovations relative to entrants',
 I set 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0.785$
\end_inset

, the complement of the internal patent share of 21.5% estimated by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Turning to the value of blocking patents, parametrized by 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 in my model, I rely on estimates by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "czarnitzkiHowValuableAre2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

, who employ merger data to obtain the effect of pre-emptive patents on
 the value of acquired firms.
 Both their estimates imply an elasticity of firm's values to the share
 of patents with pre-emptive value of more than one.
 This implies that a firm with a patent portfolio composed exclusively of
 defensive patents is valued on average twice as much as one with only patents
 that have no pre-emptive value.
 This suggest a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=2$
\end_inset

.
 As shown in the proof of Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:CGE"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, my model gives an elasticity of firms' value of at most 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega-1$
\end_inset

, therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=2$
\end_inset

 effectively caps this elasticity to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 I also include R&D subsidies, modeled as a percent subsidy on inventors'
 wages,
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, and corporate taxes applied to firms instantaneous profits, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 I set these two parameters following the values reported by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
Table

 describes my choices for the remaining parameters, which govern the scale
 of R&D and the growth rate in the economy.
 I set the incumbents' and entrants' R&D cost scale, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{I}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

, to match the share of inventors employed by incumbent firms in 1997 and
 the R&D business spending as a percent of GDP, as reported by the National
 Science Foundation.
 Intuitively, the two cost parameters jointly determine the overall R&D
 spending in the economy, while their relative value determines the distribution
 of R&D spending in equilibrium.
 Given the estimates for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{I}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

, I set 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 to match the growth in output per worker for the sectors considered in
 my analysis in 1997, 
\begin_inset Formula $3.03\%$
\end_inset

.
 All targets are matched almost exactly.

Comparative Statics in General Equilibrium
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:TwoSecAgg"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 displays the comparative statics for an increase in markup in sector 2,
 while leaving the sector 1's markup unchanged.
 The graphs compares the aggregates of interest across different constant
 growth equilibria, and each figure reports the markup of sector 2 relative
 to sector 1 on the x-axis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An increase in the relative markup of sector 2 leads to a pronounced reallocatio
n of inventors away from sector 1.
 In sector 2, incoming inventors are allocated disproportionately to incumbents,
 who expand their share of researchers relative to entrants.
 Computing the Lerner Index on NBER-CES data as described in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "app:Using-the-Lerner"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 reveals that the markup gap between more concentrated and less concentrated
 sectors has increased by about 20% over the period of interest.
 This implies a fall in inventors' productivity of 2.5% compared to the benchmark
 where the two sectors have the same competitive structure.
 Since the supply of inventors is fixed at 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{RD}=100$
\end_inset

, this also results in a 
\begin_inset Formula $2.5\%$
\end_inset

 fall in GDP growth, about 0.075pp.
 This estimate is in between the lower bound of 0.13pp implied by my estimates
 in the lower panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegProd"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and the lower bound of .03pp implied by the upper panel.
 Assuming an inelastic labor supply mutes the response of inventors' productivit
y to increases in the markup, so it is reasonable to expect the model in
 this section to understate the productivity effects of increased concentration.
 As discussed above, this benchmark is desirable since it shuts down productivit
y effects unrelated to reallocation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:TwoSecSectors"
plural "false"

 shows the changes occurring in each sector that correspond to the aggregates
 reproduced in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this figure all variables are normalized by their value in the initial
 equilibrium with 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}=\phi_{2}=1.08.$
\end_inset

 Starting from the upper-left panel, increasing markups raise profits in
 sector 2 relative to sector 1.
 This shift translates into an increase in inventors in sector 2 relative
 to sector 1.
 The upper-right panel shows that incumbents' inventor demand is more elastic
 in response to increases in the markup, which raises top firms' share in
 sector 2.
 The increase in the equilibrium inventors' wage leads to a reallocation
 within sector 1 as well, where entrants gain inventors relative to incumbents.
 As a result of these shifts, growth increases in sector 2, and falls in
 sector 1, while inventor productivity follows the opposite pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reallocation of inventors within sector 1 is a feature of the model
 that will be important to interpret the policy results in the following
 section.
 The contrasting behavior of sectors 1 and 2 reveals the crucial role of
 the overall R&D activity in shaping inventor productivity.
 The incentives to conduct defensive innovation increase when a larger number
 of inventors is employed in the sector.
 Therefore, while the movements of inventors from sector 1 to sector 2 are
 overall detrimental to growth, they are not for R&D productivity in sector
 1.
 Since incumbents there face a lower risk of being displaced by entrants,
 they reduce their efforts in defensive innovation, which increases R&D
 productivity.
 However, overall growth is lower since less R&D resources are available
 to this sector in equilibrium.
 The findings in this section suggest that inventor reallocation away from
 competitive sectors has both costs, resulting from a reduction in sectoral
 growth, and benefits, coming from a more efficient distribution of resources
 within this sector.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This comparative static exercise also clarifies how defensive innovation
 undergirds misallocation across sectors.
 In the absence of defensive innovation, inventors just reallocate across
 sectors, leaving productivity unaffected.
 As a result, overall growth is also unchanged, since the Cobb-Douglas assumptio

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Growth-Maximizing Policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I now turn to calculating the combination of R&D subsidies that maximizes
 growth.
 I assume that the planner wishes to maximize growth under a set of different
 constraint on the instruments available.
 In particular, I assume that the planner cannot alter the nature of innovation,
 that is, the planner cannot distinguish productive from unproductive projects,
 and cannot forbid registering patents that have no productive value.
 In this model, eliminating protection for incumbents would lead to a first-best
 where only entrants conduct R&D and reallocation could only promote growth,
 as discussed in the previous section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I start from the 2012 equilibrium of my model economy, where the gap in
 markups between sector 2 and sector 1 is 20%, and all firms receive a 
\begin_inset Formula $19\%$
\end_inset

 subsidy to inventors' wages and incur a 23% tax on profits.
 I then evaluate numerically three cost-neutral alternatives relative to
 this benchmark, that is, I constrain the planner to leave the expenditure
 on R&D subsidies as a percentage of GDP fixed at the 2012 benchmark.
 In the first scenario, the planner is allowed to distribute subsidies freely
 and can condition the allocation on both the state of the market (protected
 or unprotected) and the identity of the receiving firm (entrant or incumbent).
 In the other two scenarios, I only allow the planner to act on one of these
 dimensions at a time.
 That is, the planner can either control the cross-sector distribution of
 funds, but not the allocation across incumbents and entrants, or vice versa.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of this exercise are presented in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: Policy"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The 2012 equilibrium is reported in Columns 1 and 2.
 For reference, the 1997 calibrated model has two identical sectors, which
 share the stock of inventors equally.
 Within each sector incumbents have 30.3% of the overall inventors employed,
 and GDP growth is 3% per annum, as reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: intPar"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the 2012 baseline, the distribution of inventors is tilted toward the
 second sector, where markups have increased.
 This results in a fall in annual GDP growth of .07pp, about 2.5% of the 1997
 benchmark.
 As shown in the graphs above, this new equilibrium sees a larger share
 of inventors allocated to incumbents in the second sector, which increases
 its growth relative to its more competitive counterpart.
 However, productivity declines because of higher defensive innovation by
 incumbents.
 Columns 3 and 4 report the optimal cost-neutral R&D subsidies chosen by
 a growth-maximizing planner.
 Somewhat surprisingly, the most efficient allocation of funds turns out
 to be a subsidy to entrants in the more concentrated sector only.
 Indeed, defensive innovation is inefficient because it makes entrants'
 R&D less productive.
 This is the main friction that the growth-maximizing planner wishes to
 remove.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:TwoSecSectors"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that the outflow of inventors from sector 1 increases inventor productivi
ty, as lower R&D by entrants depresses defensive innovation by incumbents.
 It is therefore undesirable to reallocate inventors to entrants in sector
 1, where barriers to entry are now naturally lower.
 Conversely, the optimal policy acts directly on the higher barriers now
 present in sector 2, subsidizing inventors' wages for entrants.
 Consistent with this argument, growth is not maximized when the planner
 allocates R&D subsidies to a single sector, without condition on the identity
 of the firm.
 This scenario is reported in columns 5 and 6.
 The planner subsidizes the more competitive sector 1, which brings annual
 growth up to 2.99%, recovering most of the lost ground relative to the 1997
 benchmark.
 However, subsidies now make defensive innovation cheaper for incumbents,
 as well as more attractive due to increased entry.
 If a sector-specific subsidy to entrants is politically unfeasible, a viable
 alternative is a blanket entry subsidy as reported in Columns 7 and 8.
 The resulting growth in annual output of 3.38% exceeds the starting 1997
 equilibrium.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude, the policy analysis suggests that entry subsidies are the most
 effective policy to counter the friction introduced by defensive innovation
 in this model economy.
 The best approach is to subsidize entrants in less competitive sectors,
 where this friction is most pronounced, increasing growth by 0.5pp per annum.
 A more feasible uniform R&D subsidy to entrants produces quantitatively
 similar effects.
 Conversely, sector-specific subsidies to reallocate inventors to more competiti
ve sectors are less effective, since incumbents use them to conduct pre-emptive
 innovation, precisely the source of inefficiency that the planner wishes
 to contrast.
