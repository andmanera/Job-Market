\begin_layout Standard
My empirical analysis relies on the variation of concentration across product
 markets, as defined by 4-digit NAICS sectors, the impact of these shifts
 on the allocation of inventors with specific competences across these sectors,
 and the subsequent effect on inventor productivity.
 I use USPTO patent data to measure inventor productivity and establish
 the set of product markets that share similar inventors, and US Economic
 Census data to obtain concentration and productivity growth measures.
 Finally, I also use a dataset of product market regulations, Mercatus RegData
 4.0, to conduct an instrumental variable analysis, as well as NBER-CES to
 obtain estimates of the Lerner Index that I employ in the calibration of
 my theoretical model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My primary source is USPTO patent data from PatentsView.
 This dataset contains disambiguated patent, inventor, and assignee identifiers,
 as well as Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) classes for each of
 the patents registered from1975 to 2021.
 I then identify inventor flows across different sectors, employing the
 ALP classification of 1976-2016 patents into NAICS sectors of application
 developed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "goldschlagAlgorithmicLinksProbabilities2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Since this classification is constructed using the PATSTAT dataset, I rely
 on the crosswalk built by Gianluca Tarasconi to match these two sources.

 This leaves me with one third of all the patents registered between 1975
 and 2021, due to the restriction of the time frame to 1976-2016 and an
 incomplete match between PATSTAT and PatentsView.
 I comb patent records for self-citations, truncation-corrected forward
 citations, and patent generality, following the procedure in

\end_inset

 and

.
 I restrict my attention to utility patents, as I am interested in patents
 with a technological content and not just design improvements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My main source for concentration and sales data is the US Economic Census
 (EC), which reports sales shares for the top 4, 8, 20, and 50 firms; the
 Herfindal-Hirschman Index; sales and number of companies in various NAICS
 4-digit sectors at a 5-year frequency.
 I restrict my attention to the period between 1997 and 2012 for three main
 reasons.
 First, as I show below, this period saw substantial increase in the concentrati
on of inventors in specific technology classes.
 Second, the start of this period coincides with an acceleration in the
 growth of market concentration and markups

\end_inset

.
 Third, 1997 saw the adoption of the NAICS classification, thus ensuring
 a consistent definition of product markets throughout the period I analyze
 As my baseline concentration measure, I rely on the HHI lower bound constructed
 by

\end_inset

 I did so because the Economic Census reports the HHI only for a subset
 of industries, which would severely limit my sample.
 The method proposed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "keilTroubleApproximatingIndustry2017"

\end_inset

 obviates this issue by constructing the implied lower bound of the HHI
 implied by top sales shares reported in the Economic Census, which are
 available for a much wider set of industries than the HHI.

 this measure is very strongly correlated with the HHI reported by the Economic
 Census when this is available, with a correlation of around 0.93.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 While my estimates are robust to using the EC-reported HHI, this choice
 allows me to obtain more power for my findings as well as to generalize
 them.

 This dataset allows me to analyze the evolution in patent litigation across
 NAICS 4-digit sectors for the sub-period 2002-2012.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Economic Census also provides sector-level growth in output per worker,
 which constitutes my main measure of productivity growth.
 I choose this measure instead of multi-factor productivity since the latter
 is available only for a limited set of sectors, mostly in manufacturing.
 I deflate sales using NAICS-specific price indices from the Bureau of Labor
 Statistics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I employ two additional data sources in the empirical analysis and in the
 calibration of my model.
 First, I obtain sector-specific counts of regulations for various NAICS
 4-digit sector from the Mercatus RegData 4.0 dataset.
 I employ them to conduct an instrumental variable analysis, strengthening
 the causal interpretation of my results.

 illustrates how I construct knowledge markets.
 Each node in the Figure represents a different NAICS 4-digit sector, and
 the black lines designate the inventor flows.
 The procedure shows how I determine these flows and measure their strength.
 After obtaining these weighted flows, I employ a community detection algorithm
 to group together sectors most closely connected.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 depicts strong flows among grain, vegetable farming and animal food manufacturi
ng, all of which involve knowledge related to agriculture and nutrition,
 and separately between footwear and tanning, which both require knowledge
 of leather crafting.
 In this case, my algorithm would identify two knowledge markets, one given
 by the agriculture and food manufacturing sectors, and the other by leather
 crafting sectors, leaving the laundry services sector isolated.
 Based on the strength of connections, we would expect increased concentration
 in footwear manufacturing to attract inventors away from leather tanning,
 but not from vegetable farming.
 Increased concentration in the laundry sector, which has weak ties to the
 other sectors, would lead to negligible inventor movement within this particula
r grouping.

Note: This figure provides a graphical illustration of the definition of
 knowledge markets as sets of product markets sharing the same required
 knowledge to innovate.
 This illustration is based on transitions of inventors across product markets
 observed in my data and classified in the same knowledge markets, although
 many other sectors in these markets are excluded for the sake of exposition.
 In the figure, nodes represent NAICS sectors 1111 (Oilseed and Grain Farming),
 1112 (Vegetable and Melon Farming), 3111 (Animal Food Manufacturing), 3161
 (Leather and Hide Tanning and Finishing), 3162 (Footwear Manufacturing),
 and 8123 (Drycleaning and Laundry Services).
 The edges connecting nodes represent inventor transitions across sectors,
 while the width of these edges represents the strength of the connection
 between the two sectors as measured by undirected inventor flows.

 to construct knowledge markets.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 depicts a hypothetical matching of the USPTO dataset with NAICS classifications.
 Note that the first patent has multiple inventors and is applicable to
 multiple sectors.
 Inventors are each assigned a disambiguated ID corresponding to the serial
 number of their first patent.
 In this example, inventor 00001-1 and 00001-2 both cooperate on the development
 of patent US00001.
 The third column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 classification for NAICS 4-digit industries.
 This classification is not limited to a single sector per patent, and includes
 multiple sectors in almost all instances.
 For instance, patent US00001 relates to multiple sectors, while patent
 US00002 is applicable to just one sector.
 Importantly, this classification captures the 
\emph on
technological nature
\emph default
 of the patent and the sectors of application of the knowledge required
 to develop that patent.
 While other classifications, like the CPC or the USPC, also describe the
 technological nature of patents, they do not allow a direct match to sectors
 of application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given this data structure, I define a transition in two ways.
 First, I consider inventor transitions 
\emph on
within patents.

\emph default
 That is, I consider that an inventor transition occurs between two sectors
 if an inventor works on a patent that applies to both.
 The direction of flows does not matter for the definition of knowledge
 markets, since I am only interested in grouping sectors that exchange researche
rs.
 Table

 The second type of transition that I consider is 
\emph on
across patents
\emph default
.
 This transition occurs when an inventor applies his knowledge to patents
 in different product markets, such as between sector 1112 and 3111 by inventor
 00001-1.
 The raw count of transitions of inventors across sectors in each year constitut
es the basis of my measure of inventor flows.

Weighting Inventor Flows: Effective Inventors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After identifying transitions, I proceed to weigh them by two alternative
 measures in order to assess the flow of inventors across sectors.
 The first measure weighs each transition equally, computing inventor flows
 as the raw count of researchers moving across NAICS.
 The second measure adjusts for the productivity of individual inventors,
 since raw counts might overstate or understate the importance of each transitio
n, depending on the size of origin and destination sectors, their technological
 nature, as well as the proficiency of each inventor.
 I therefore define a measure of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

effective inventors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that aims to correct for these and other omitted factors.
 For each inventor,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I estimate the fixed effect, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i},$
\end_inset

 in the fully-saturated regression 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\text{\#Patents}_{cfit} & =\alpha_{i}+\gamma_{cft}+\varepsilon_{cfit},\label{eq:one-1-1}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\#Patents}_{cfit}$
\end_inset

 denotes the number of patents registered in CPC class 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

; firm (assignee) 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

; and year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, that include inventor 
\begin_inset Formula $i.$
\end_inset

 In this regression 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{cft}$
\end_inset

 denotes a of CPC class by firm (assignee) by year fixed effect.
 I choose to include indicators for one-digit CPC classes, the broadest
 classification, to identify as many fixed effects as possible.
 The fixed effect 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{cft}$
\end_inset

 controls for specific technological features of the patented technology,
 the firm environment, as well as the year.
 Further, this specification produces an estimate of inventor productivity
 that accounts for the number of collaborators on each patent.
 Given this specification, I define an 
\emph on
effective inventor
\emph default
 as one unit of the resulting fixed effect 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

, rescaled to take nonnegative values.
 Since these fixed effects might be inconsistently estimated, I check the
 robustness of all my results, including the construction of knowledge markets,
 to the use of the raw count of inventors.
\end_layout

Armed with the results of this estimate, I define

that is, the sum of transition counts weighted by effective inventors.
 The total undirected flow between two sectors is then given by the sum
 of inflows and outflows with ends in one of the two sectors: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
flow_{jk}=\sum_{t}\left(flow_{j\rightarrow k,t}+flow_{k\rightarrow j,t}\right).
\]

\end_inset

This flow measure defines a network of inventor transitions across product
 markets, where the nodes, 
\begin_inset Formula $j,k$
\end_inset

, are given by 4-digit NAICS codes, edges are given by transitions across
 sectors, and edge weights are defined as a rescaled version of 
\begin_inset Formula $flow_{jk}.$
\end_inset

 I use these edge weights as a measure of the strength of the connection
 between pairs of sectors in the network.
 Rescaling the flow measure is necessary in order to exclude effects of
 sector size as well as to avoid double counting of inventors.
 I describe how I rescale this series in Appendix

Community Detection and Resulting Knowledge Markets

I use the rescaled undirected flow measure as a network edge weight to identify
 communities through the Louvain algorithm developed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This procedure maximizes the modularity of the network by choosing the
 number of communities (knowledge markets) and the assignment of nodes (NAICS
 sectors) to communities.
 Modularity, a commonly used measure of connectedness of networks, measures
 the distance between the density of links 
\emph on
within
\emph default
 communities versus 
\emph on
between.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This procedures produces 10 sets of NAICS 4-digit sectors that share the
 same inventors and have concentration measures.
 Applying the community detection algorithm results in knowledge markets
 that do not overlap: Each NAICS 4-digit sector belongs to one and only
 one knowledge market.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 displays the result of my procedure applied to NAICS 3-digit sectors.
 I report this exercise since the 4-digit equivalent would be too dense
 to depict.
 However, the knowledge markets identified by the two exercises are qualitativel
y similar although they are clearly more numerous in the 4-digit case.
 In this figure, lines denote inventor transitions, with width proportional
 to the effective undirected inventor flow between sectors.
 Nodes represent NAICS 3-digit.
 Black lines depict flows within knowledge markets, while gray lines represent
 transitions between communities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three features are worth emphasizing.
 First, the network is very dense, and transitions across 3-digit as well
 as 2-digit sectors are pervasive, differing largely in intensity.
 This approach is far more illuminating than grouping sectors based on broad
 product markets, which would neglect the linkages across disparate markets,
 or pooling all sectors together, which would neglect the difference in
 the strength of inventor flows.
 Second, the flows between communities appear more numerous than within
 communities, but this is solely a by-product of the circular layout of
 the network, whereby nodes mask flows within close communities on the circle.
 When applying the algorithm to 4-digit sectors, I find that less than a
 third of flows occur between communities, as expected since the community
 detection algorithm maximizes the density of within-community linkages.
 Third, and perhaps most importantly, the classification that I obtain sensibly
 groups together sectors that we might expect to share similar knowledge
 to innovate.
 Starting from sector 111 and going counter-clockwise, the knowledge markets
 in the figure can be described as follows.
 The first market, including sector 111, groups sectors involving agricultural
 production (111, 112 and 114) and food manufacturing (311).
 The second market, starting with 211, includes oil, gas, and mining.
 The green cluster at the top of the figure groups several heavy manufacturing
 industries, such as chemicals plastics and petroleum products, and pipeline
 transportation (486).
 The market in yellow consists largely of transportation services and manufactur
ing as well as motor vehicle dealers.
 The large blue cluster captures many retail sectors, as well as data processing
, telecom, and broadcasting services.
 The remaining three markets include insurance and finance (red cluster),
 computer, electronics, and machinery manufacturing and professional services
 (violet), and wholesalers (gray).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowledge markets are identified using my measure of effective inventors,
 but the algorithm produces nearly identical results when using raw inventor
 counts; more than 97% of 4-digit NAICS sectors are classified in the same
 manner using the two measures.
 That is, 97% of sector pairs belong to the same knowledge market according
 to both measures.

Patent Citation Measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each patent classified by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "goldschlagAlgorithmicLinksProbabilities2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I compute self-citations, forward citations, and a measure of patent generalit
y.
 To count self-citations, I first identify the set of cited patents that
 belong to the same assignee as the citing patent.
 I weigh self-citations to account for cited patents that have multiple
 assignees.
 I count as one self-citation instances where the patent has a single assignee,
 and as one half if the cited patent has multiple assignees.
 The share of self-citations is given by the sum of weighted self-citations
 divided by the number of patents cited by each assignee.
 I construct five measures to correct self-citations for the assignee's
 importance in the relevant technology class of cited patents.
 For each citation made, excess self-citations are defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $1-Pr\left(\text{self-citation}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The measure depends on how the probability of self-citation is computed.
 For the first three measures, I compute this probability as the assignee's
 share of total patents in the NAICS code attributed to the citing patent.
 I employ in turn the share of NAICS patents for the year of citation, the
 previous five years, and the cumulative share from the beginning of the
 sample.
 The other two measures are based on the CPC classification at the group
 and subgroup levels (the lowest levels of detail in the classification).
 For this measure, the probability of self-citation is derived for each
 citation by taking the share of patents by the assignee in the CPC (sub)group
 and the year corresponding to the cited patents.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This procedure is similar to the approach followed in Akcigit and Kerr's
 (2018) Appendix C.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Finally, I aggregate all measures across assignees in the same NAICS 4-digit
 code using the number of patents in the relevant code by each assignee
 in each year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I also construct two truncation-corrected forward citation measures and
 a patent generality measure following the definitions and the procedures
 described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hallNBERPatentCitation2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The forward citation measures compute the average number of citations received
 by each firm's patents, giving an indication of the importance of each
 patent for future technological developments.
 The correction for truncation is conducted by estimating the empirical
 CDF of the forward citations lag distribution of patents in the relevant
 CPC 2-digit technology class.
 The correction is then carried out by dividing the overall number of forward
 citations at the latest available date by the inverse of the CDF thus obtained.
 The procedure suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hallNBERPatentCitation2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 uses only information pertaining to the CPC 2-digit technology class of
 the cited patent.
 I also conduct an alternative correction that estimates a separate distribution
 for each citing CPC 2-digit class and sums the corrected forward citations
 across all citing classes.
 Patent generality also measures the technological impact of patents, but
 rather than focusing on citations it examines the scope of application
 of the patent.
 In particular, it measures the dispersion of citations received across
 different CPC classes.
 The higher the dispersion, the wider the technological applicability of
 the patent.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Regulation Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mercatus RegData provides a count of restrictions imposed on a number of
 NAICS 4-digit product markets, obtained by matching a set of keywords in
 NAICS descriptions to regulatory texts, and then taking the best match
 for each document.
 However, the available data does not include a set of codes due to data
 quality reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, I process the description of NAICS 4-digit codes and compute
 the cosine-similarity between all pairs of sectors.
 I build an estimate of sector-relevant restrictions for missing sectors
 by taking an average weighted by cosine similarity of sectors included
 in RegData.
 I include in the average the five most similar NAICS codes if similarity
 is larger than .2, and I attribute the regulations of the most similar sector
 otherwise.
 I chose this threshold by inspecting the similarity associated to various
 NAICS pairs, and the assignment of regulations to sectors is not highly
 sensitive to this choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Inventor Distribution Measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I employ the measure of effective inventors constructed as detailed above
 to compute measures of researchers' concentration within sectors for each
 year in my sample.
 Specifically, I use the PatentsView assignee ID to identify firms that
 employ specific inventors in each sector, and then compute several measures
 of the concentration of inventors within sectors.
 I focus on the top 10% and bottom 50% share of inventors.
 I also use other common measures of dispersion like the ratio of the 
\begin_inset Formula $90^{th}$
\end_inset

 quantile to the median.
 I compute the Gini coefficient of inventors across CPC classes and NAICS
 4-digit, assigning effective inventors to the relevant technology class
 or NAICS sector, to document increasing concentration of inventors in specific
 patent classes and sectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Patent Litigation Cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I match the data on litigation cases compiled by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "schwartzUSPTOPatentNumber2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 with the data on inventors by NAICS 4-digit.
 For each sector, I compute the number of litigation cases per patent.
 These data are available only for the sub-period 2003-2016, which does
 not allow me to reliably estimate an empirical CDF of cases to correct
 for truncation.
 I therefore choose to keep only the litigation cases occurring in the same
 year as the patent registration, which amounts to assuming that the time
 profile of cases is constant over time and across sectors.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
More precisely, this would be the same as using only the contemporaneous
 patent litigation cases and correcting for truncation dividing by the inverse
 CDF at period 0, which would scale the estimated coefficient upwards.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 I then average the litigations per patent over the years 2003-2006 and
 2013-2016 for the Economic Census waves 2002 and 2012 respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Aggregation at Census Frequency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data from the Economic Census are available at five-year intervals for the
 years 1997-2017, which requires aggregating the other data at the same
 frequency.
 Since I am interested in the effect of concentration on the allocation
 of inventors, I average all variables related to inventors and productivity
 using the five-year window 
\emph on
starting
\emph default
 in the census year (e.g., 1997- 2001 for 1997), while I use concentration
 measures for the corresponding census year.
 In the IV regression I use product restrictions as an instrument for concentrat
ion, which is why I average restrictions in the five-year window 
\emph on
ending
\emph default
 in the census year (e.g., 1993-1997 for 1997).
 Since 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

's matching only covers the period up to 2016, I run all specifications
 in long-differences over the time frame 1997-2012, with the exception of
 the patent litigation regression which uses the period 2002-2012.

\begin_layout Section
Empirical Analysis
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Results"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section presents four main findings that apply to the period 1997-2012:
 (i) effective inventors became more concentrated across economic sectors;
 (ii) sectors with increased product market concentration attracted a growing
 share of relevant inventor types; (iii) growth in the share of relevant
 inventors negatively correlated with inventor productivity, as measured
 by forward citations as well as average growth in output per worker divided
 by effective inventors employed; and (iv) growth in the share of relevant
 inventors positively correlated with the share of self-citations and excess
 self-citations, as well as concentration of inventors at the top within
 sectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results (i) and (ii) indicate a positive causal link between the growth
 in product market concentration and the increase in sectors' inventor share.
 Findings (iii) and (iv) point to misallocation: Inventor concentration
 in less competitive sectors turns out to be inefficient, as researchers
 are predominantly employed on projects that do not contribute to the growth
 of the sector.
 This work amounts to defensive innovation, as evidenced by the decline
 in forward citations of patents obtained by these firms and the decrease
 in growth per inventor that accompanies the increase in product market
 concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of this section proceeds as follows.
 The first subsection presents my empirical framework and variable definition.
 Remaining sections present in order results (i)-(iv) above.
 I discuss the causal interpretation of my results through an IV specification

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

.
 For each product market 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, I define the share of inventors employed by the sector in year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Inventor\ Share}{}_{p,t}\equiv\frac{\sum_{p(i,t)=p}\alpha_{i}}{\sum_{k(i,t)=k}\alpha_{i}},
\]

\end_inset

where the numerator represents the sum of effective inventors cited in patents
 registered in product market 
\begin_inset Formula $p,$
\end_inset

 while the denominator consists of the total effective inventors that belong
 to the knowledge market.
 Effective inventors 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 are also the measure I use to evaluate the dispersion of inventors across
 sectors and technology classes.
 My results are robust to computing the inventor share using raw counts
 of researchers instead of effective inventors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When analyzing R&D productivity I focus on the three patent-based measures
 described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Other data and aggregation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, that is, forward citations, share of self-citations, and patent generality.
 Further, I compute a more direct measure of the productivity of inventors
 given by calculating the growth in output per worker divided by the number
 of effective inventors employed by the sector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In most specifications, the independent variables are measures of concentration
 and controls for the size of the sector considered.
 As discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 using top sales share reported by the Economic Census for each sector.

\text{\ensuremath{\underbar{HHI}}}_{p,t} & =4\left[\frac{\text{CR4}_{p,t}}{4}\right]^{2}+4\left[\frac{\text{CR8}_{p,t}-\text{CR4}_{p,t}}{4}\right]^{2}+12\left[\frac{\text{CR20}_{p,t}-\text{CR8}_{p,t}}{12}\right]^{2}+30\left[\frac{\text{CR50}_{p,t}-\text{CR20}_{p,t}}{30}\right]^{2},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CR{X}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 denotes the concentration ratio, that is the share of sales, of the top
 X firms.
 This measure is a lower bound, and coincides with the actual HHI if the
 sector has less than 50 firms, and sales share are distributed equally
 in each of the top 0-4, 5-8, 9-20, 21-50 brackets.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset Formula $\text{\ensuremath{\underbar{HHI}}}$

\end_layout

\end_inset

 I label this variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\text{HHI}}_{p,t}$
\end_inset

, where the line below stands for the lower bound.
 I chose this measure because my sample includes a relatively small number
 (about 80) of sectors that have an HHI index reported by the Economic Census.
 Using the lower bound allows me to expand the sample to157 sectors.
 The Economic Census HHI and its lower bound estimate are highly correlated
 and produce equivalent results, as shown in Table 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I obtain measures of sales from the Economic Census, which I deflate using
 BLS NAICS-specific price indexes.
 I use sales variables for two purposes.
 First, real sales in 2012 are the weight in my regressions.
 Second, I use the logarithm real sales as well as a quartic in real sales
 to control for changes in the size of sectors during my sample period.
 For the selected subset of sectors that reports the number of companies,
 I also explore the robustness of my findings to controlling for sales per
 company, which provide a proxy for the average firm size in these sectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given these definitions, my main specification is a sector-level long-difference
 regression over the period 1997-2012 
\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\text{Share}$
\end_inset

 denotes the change in the inventors' share of product market 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $f_{k}\mathbf{1}\left\{ p\in k\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a dummy variable that takes value 1 if the product market belongs to
 knowledge market 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\underline{\text{HHI}}$
\end_inset

 is the change in the HHI lower bound; and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\text{Size}$
\end_inset

 is a set of controls for the size of sector 
\emph on
p
\emph default
.
 Depending on the specification, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\text{Size}$
\end_inset

 is the change in log real sales, the change in log real sales per firm,
 or the change in the terms of a quadratic polynomial in real sales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regressions are weighted by sector sales in 2012 for the findings which
 rely on Economic Census sector-level measures, and I estimate robust standard
 errors in all specifications.
 When looking at patent measures, I employ the same specification as in
 equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: spec"
plural "false"

, where I replace the outcome variable with the change in patent productivity
 and the independent variable with the change in inventors' share.
 In this case, since I do not rely on Economic Census measures, I report
 unweighted regressions.
\begin_inset Foot

 These patterns align closely with trends reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The increase in inventor concentration is sizable, corresponding to about
 a 20% increase in the HHI for the effective inventor measure over the period

 Based on raw inventor data, the figure rises to 30%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the results presented below, the effective inventor measure and the
 raw inventor count behave similarly, although the series for raw counts
 is more volatile and exhibits larger changes.
 The figure for effective inventors is less volatile since this measure

Two important notes on the scale of the variables are in order.
 First, here and in all following tables and graphs, all variables that
 refer to shares or growth rates are reported in percentage points for ease
 of interpretation.
 With regard to the coefficient in Column (1) of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvNoctrl"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, for example, an increase in one unit of the HHI index leads to an increase
 in the share of the relevant knowledge market of 
\begin_inset Formula $27.25$
\end_inset

 percentage points.
 Second, HHI indices are constructed to range between 0 and 1.
 In 2012, the HHI lower bound has a sales-weighted average of .03 and a standard
 deviation of .032.
 According to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvNoctrl"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, a standard deviation increase in this measure is associated with a .87
 percentage point increase in the share of inventors accruing to the relevant
 NAICS sector.
 In comparison, the sales-weighted average share of inventors in 2012 is
 1.18%, with a standard deviation of 1.82%, so the estimated effect of a one
 standard deviation increase in concentration corresponds to about half
 a standard deviation increase in the share of inventors in the relevant
 market.
 The estimates using the HHI lower bound tend to be noisier as this is a
 constructed, and therefore imprecise, measure of concentration.
 However, the number of available observations is much larger than the actual
 HHI, allowing me to extend my findings to about double the number of sectors.

While suggestive, the correlation presented above neglects two fundamental
 components.
 First, it does not include controls for the size of the sectors or firms,
 which could have a confounding and mechanical effect on the share of scientists.
 Second, it estimates the correlation both across and within knowledge markets.
 In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvHHI"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, I address these two limitations by restricting the analysis to within
 knowledge markets, and controlling for two measures of size.
 In the upper panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvHHI"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the change in the logarithm of real sales serves as a measure of the change
 in the size of each sector, while the lower panel shows the results when
 average sales per firm are included as a control.
 I include sales per firm to account for the fact that there might be significan
t barriers to entry in R&D.
 These barriers might be easier to overcome for larger firms, mechanically
 linking concentration and inventor hiring.
 Since the Economic Census reports the number of companies only for a subset
 of firms, the sample used in the lower panel is smaller than in the upper
 panel.
 The results in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvHHI"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 confirm the positive relation between the change in inventor shares and
 concentration.
 They are largely unchanged relative to the estimates in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvNoctrl"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, suggesting that the correlation does not arise mechanically from factors
 related to firm or sector size.
 In particular, these findings imply that sectors with increasing concentration
 have attracted a rising share of scientists above what would be predicted
 by their expansion in overall sales and in average firm size.

, Panel (a).
 The upper panel portrays changes of knowledge-market inventor shares over
 the change in the HHI lower bound, after partialling out fixed effects
 for the relevant knowledge market and changes in log real sales.
 The marker size is proportional to the regression weight.
 Although the sample displays some observations that appear extreme, the
 bulk of observations—and especially of weighted observations—falls on the
 regression lines, mitigating concerns that a few outliers might drive the
 results.
 In any event, I explore the robustness of the results to the exclusion
 of non-residualized observations, identifying extreme observations either
 manually, or using the Mahalanobis distance.
 Importantly, this exercise reveals that the observations that appear extreme
 in the residualized scatter are not unusual when considering the marginal
 or joint distribution of non-residualized outcome and independent variables.
 The bottom panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 extreme observations according to the Mahalanobis distance have been removed.
 It confirms that the positive relation between concentration and inventor

 market over the total.
 This amounts to neglecting the fact that inventors flow only across sectors
 that can employ their skills.
 In this specification, I find a significant, albeit small, effect of product
 market concentration on the share of inventors.
 However, this result only arises when the sample is trimmed to remove outliers.
 This is not surprising, considering that mismeasuring the labor market
 for inventors should bias the estimates of inventor mobility towards zero,
 since many of the sectors would not be routinely connected by inventor
 flows.
 Addionally, this result conforms with the findings in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Paragraph
IV Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I now present instrumental variable results that suggest that the relation
 between concentration and inventor shares is causal.
 Indeed, more concentration could be the result of increasing technological
 entry barriers as incumbents hire more R&D inventors.
 In this scenario, the causality would flow from increased inventor shares
 to higher concentration.
 Above, I tried to mitigate this concern using as my outcome variable the
 average share of inventors following the Economic Census years to which
 the HHI refers.
 However, reverse causality could still be present if the autocorrelation
 of inventor shares is sufficiently high.
 As a consequence, I have calculated 2SLS estimates that instrument the
 change in the HHI lower bound with changes in product market restrictions,
 as measured by the Mercatus dataset RegData 4.0.
 Theoretically, an increase in restrictions should raise barriers to entry
 in affected product markets, thus leading to higher concentration.
 As discussed below, such proves to be the case empirically, validating
 sector-specific restrictions as an instrument for concentration.
 A violation of the exclusion restriction requires a causal connection between
 product market regulations and the share of inventors hired by each sector,
 independent of product market concentration.
 For example, regulations affecting existing technologies might require
 more inventors to meet product market restrictions.
 However, this effect is unlikely to be sufficiently large and persistent
 to be captured by my measure of inventor shares.
 Further, the regulations counted in RegData are not exclusively product
 restrictions, but also include reporting obligations and other legal burdens
 that are not related to technological components.
 In addition, while product restrictions might certainly induce a change
 in the direction of innovation, there is no a priori reason to believe
 that the scale of innovation activity should increase.
 These considerations lead me to believe that the exclusion restriction
 is not likely to be violated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of the 2SLS estimation are presented in the upper panel of Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvHHI"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, including both knowledge market and sale change fixed effects.
 The 2SLS estimates confirm the significance of concentration changes for
 the increase in knowledge market inventor shares.
 The magnitudes of estimated coefficients are statistically indistinguishable
 from the ones reported in the baseline regression.
 The first-stage F clearly indicates that instruments are weak.
 This is unsurprising since, as detailed above, both the HHI lower bound
 and the regulation measures are estimated.
 In particular, I had to impute regulations for a large part of the sample
 using the cosine-similarity between product market restrictions.

 The results in the lower panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 imply that the first-stage t-statistic for the regression of the change
 in the HHI lower bound over log-regulations is 2.07, which corresponds to
 a p-value of 0.041.
 The reduced form regression of inventor share over log restriction change
 is as highly significant.
 Accordingly, the SW underidentification test rejects the null hypothesis
 at a 5% confidence level.
 Given the weakness of the instruments, I also report the Anderson-Rubin
 p-value and the corresponding confidence intervals in brackets, which confirm
 that the coefficient is 5% significant.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sectors that Attracted More Researchers Saw Increasing Top Firms' Inventor
 Shares and Falling Patent Forward Citations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the findings presented so far establish a connection between inventor
 and product market concentration, they do not establish that changes in
 the distribution of researchers across sectors are inefficient.
 It would not be unreasonable, for example, to think that more concentrated
 sectors saw increased entry as a result of the higher rents captured by
 incumbents.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegStats"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows that the opposite occurred.
 Specifically, the share of effective inventors accruing to top inventor-hiring
 firms increased in the sectors that attracted more inventors over the period
 considered, relative to firms with fewer inventors in the sector—a finding
 consistent across a variety of measures displayed in Columns (1) to (6).
 These outcomes suggest that inventors have increasingly concentrated among
 large incumbents, that is, sectors that increased their inventor share
 also saw a 
\emph on
within-sector
\emph default
 increase in inventor concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout this section, I present results using changes in inventor shares
 to focus directly on the correlation between inventor transitions and their
 within-sector distribution.
 Unless otherwise noted, these findings are robust to using the change in
 the HHI rather than the inventor share, as should be expected from the
 strong correlation between these two variables reported in previous tables.
 For this section, and other patent-based measures, I present robustness
 results using the change in the HHI in Appendix

My next finding suggests that inventor concentration is driven by a rise
 in defensive innovation, that is R&D aimed at protecting the incumbents'
 dominant position and raising barriers to entry.
 Table

 shows that inventors' concentration in specific sectors went hand in hand
 with a fall in forward citations for patents, a standard measure of a patent's
 contribution to further innovations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hallNBERPatentCitation2001"

\end_inset

.
 The result in Columns (1) and (2) report two different measures of forward
 citations that differ in how the series are corrected for truncation.
 As discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Other data and aggregation"

\end_inset

, the measure in Column (2) uses the procedure delineated by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hallNBERPatentCitation2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, computing the forward citation lag distribution conditioning on the technology
 class of the cited patent.
 Column (2) also conditions on the technology class of citing patents.
 Column (3) presents the estimates relative to patent generality, a measure
 of patent impact that increases with the scope of application.
 The regressions in this table are unweighted since they rely only on patent
 data, but results are robust to using the HHI as a regressor and weighting
 by sales.
 I present results for the full sample, as well as restricting to the middle
 range of changes in inventor shares, which contains more than 90% of the
 observations.
 In both samples, I find a highly significant negative relation between
 changes in inventor shares and the fall in forward citations.
 The coefficients imply a high semi-elasticity of self citations to changes
 in the inventor shares, whereby a 1 percentage point increase in the share
 of inventors leads to a 0.2-0.5% reduction in forward citations.
 After dropping extreme observations, I also find a significant decrease
 in the generality of the patents, indicating that concentrating sectors
 produce less widely applicable patents.
 However, the generality finding is not robust to estimating the regression
 using the HHI as the independent variable.

 In the next section, I show that these patents also appear to do relatively
 little to boost productivity, as measured by growth in output per worker.

Before moving to the results on productivity, I investigate a competing

 As highlighted by

 among others, large incumbents have a strong incentive to focus on improving
 their own products at the expense of broadly applicable innovation.
 This mechanism would also imply that an increase in incumbents' share of
 R&D resources leads to falling innovation productivity.
 In order to assess the importance of this channel, and in keeping with
 the analysis in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 as defined in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Columns (1) and (2) build excess self-citations correcting for the importance
 of firms' patents for the CPC group, which reflects the technological classific
ation of the patent.
 Columns (3) and (4) use the more narrowly defined CPC subgroups for robustness.
 Coefficients are mostly non-significant and turn negative when knowledge
 market fixed effects are included.
 Column (3) displays a marginally significant coefficient.
 However, this result is not robust to using the HHI as regressor and weighting
 regressions by sales as in the baseline specification.
 The findings in this table suggest that incremental innovation does not
 drive my results.

 Inventor productivity is then defined as average output per worker growth

 This number decreases to 
\begin_inset Formula $-.28\text{pp}$
\end_inset

 when considering only sectors with positive growth in labor productivity,
 which accounted for the bulk of the increase in inventor shares.
 An alternative back-of-the-envelope computation, using the change in product

 starker results.
 Using the coefficient in Column (2) of Table

 sectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.045\text{pp}$
\end_inset

 This implies a fall in average labor productivity implied by misallocation
 of 0.45pp.
 While these numbers might appear large considering the entirety of the
 economy, it is worth noting that my sample includes mainly manufacturing
 and retail sectors, which experienced a sizable reduction of 
\begin_inset Formula $2.73pp$
\end_inset

 in average annual productivity growth from 1997 to 2012, driven by a steep
 decline in output per worker growth in manufacturing.
 Therefore, the mechanism I propose would explain around 15 percent of the

 Using the estimates in Column (2), a median HHI change of 0.02 and a median
 number of effective inventors of 1421 in sectors with growth in inventor
 shares implies a

 interval ranging from

 The midpoint of these estimates would explain
