\begin_layout Standard
My empirical analysis relies on the variation of concentration across product
 markets, as defined by 4-digit NAICS sectors, and the impact of these shifts
 on the allocation of inventors with specific competences across these sectors,
 and their effect on inventors' productivity.
 I use USPTO patent data to measure inventor productivity and establish
 the set of product markets that share similar inventors, and US Economic
 Census data to obtain concentration and productivity growth measures.
 Finally, I also use a dataset of product market regulations, Mercatus RegData
 4.0, to conduct an instrumental variable analysis, as well as NBER-CES that
 I employ to obtain estimates of the Lerner Index that I employ in the calibrati
on of my theoretical model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My primary source is given by USPTO patent data from PatentsView.
 This dataset contains disambiguated patent, inventor and assignee identifiers,
 as well as Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) classes for each of
 the patents deposited in the period 1975-2021.
 I employ these data to construct inventor flows across different sectors,
 which I build employing the ALP classification of 1976-2016 patents into
 NAICS sectors of application developed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "goldschlagAlgorithmicLinksProbabilities2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Since this classification is constructed using the PATSTAT dataset, I rely
 on the crosswalk built by Gianluca Tarasconi to match these two sources.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

 This leaves me with around one third of all the patents registered between
 1975 and 2021, due to the restriction of the time frame to 1976-2016 as
 well as an incomplete match between PATSTAT and PatentsView.
 Patent data also provides my with citation data, which I use to build self-cita
tions as well as truncation-corrected forward citations and patent generality,
 following the procedure in

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 I restrict my attention to utility patents, since I am interested in patents
 with a technological content, and not just design improvements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My main data source for concentration and sales data is given by the US
 Economic Census (EC), which reports sales shares for the top 4, 8, 20,
 and 50 firms, Herfindal-Hirschman Index, sales and number of companies
 in various NAICS 4-digit sectors at a 5 year frequency.
 I restrict my attention to the period between 1997 and 2012 for three main
 reasons.
 First, as I show below, this period saw a substantial increase in the concentra
tion of inventors in specific technology classes.
 Second, the start of this period coincides with an acceleration in the
 growth of market concentration and markups

key "deloeckerRiseMarketPower2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Third, 1997 marks the adoption of the NAICS classification, ensuring a
 consistent definition of product markets throughout the period I analyze,
 without the need to rely on crosswalk with the pre-existing SIC classification.
 As my baseline concentration measure, I rely on the HHI lower bound constructed
 by

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

 This choice is dictated by the fact that the Economic Census reports the
 HHI only for a subset of industries, which would severely limit my sample.
 The method proposed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "keilTroubleApproximatingIndustry2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 obviates to this issue by constructing the implied lower bound of the HHI
 implied by top sales shares reported in the Economic Census, which are
 available for a much wider set of industries than the HHI.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As detailed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "keilTroubleApproximatingIndustry2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 this measure is very strongly correlated with the HHI reported by the Economic
 Census when this is available, with a correlation of around 0.93.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 While my estimates are robust to using the EC-reported HHI, this choice
 allows me to obtain more power for my findings as well as generalize them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Economic Census also provides me with sector-level growth in output
 per worker, which constitutes my main measure of productivity growth in
 the sectors I analyze.
 I choose this measure instead of multi-factor productivity since the latter
 is available only for a limited set of sectors, mostly in manufacturing.
 I deflate sales using NAICS-specific price indices from the BLS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I employ two additional data sources in the empirical analysis and in the
 calibration of my model.
 First, I obtain sector-specific counts of regulations for various NAICS
 4-digit sector from the Mercatus RegData 4.0 dataset, which I employ to
 conduct an instrumental variable analysis, strengthening the causal interpretat
ion of my results.

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Matching my various data sources results in a dataset of 157 NAICS 4-digit
 sectors over the period 1997-2012, out of a total of 304 business sectors,
 for which I have data on concentration and that I merge to my estimates
 of knowledge markets.

\begin_layout Subsection
Effective Inventors and Knowledge Markets
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to identify the effect of product market concentration on the allocatio
n of inventors, I first have to establish which set of sectors different
 categories of inventors can actually choose from.
 Indeed, pooling all sectors together would inevitably attenuate the response
 of the inventor distribution to changes in the features of individual product
 markets, as this design would correspond to the assumption that all inventors
 could potentially be employed by any sector.
 Since inventors have limited employment opportunities due to their specific
 skills set, this assumption would incorrectly suggest that, in a majority
 of cases, sector characteristics have no impact on the allocation of researcher
s.
 That is, the mismeasurement of labor market for inventors would produce
 an attenuation bias in my coefficient of interest.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main aim of this section is correctly grouping product markets that
 share the same 
\emph on
required knowledge to innovate
\emph default
, and therefore compete for the same R&D inputs, namely inventors.
 In practice, I construct transition of inventors across different product
 markets, and use the resulting network of flows to identify sectors that
 routinely exchange researchers through a Louvain community-detection algorithm

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 presents a graphical illustration that clarifies my definition of knowledge
 markets as well as the procedure I follow to construct them.
 Each node in the Figure represents a different NAICS 4-digit sector, which
 is connected to other sectors by inventor flows, indicated with black lines.
 The width of each line represents the strength of these flows.
 The procedure described in detail in the rest of this section, shows how
 I define these flows and measure their strength.
 After obtaining these weighted flows, I employ a community detection algorithm
 to group together sectors that are most closely connected to each other.
 In the sectors that I selected for this illustration, as one might expect,
 there are strong flows between grain, vegetable farming and animal food
 manufacturing, all of which involve knowledge related to agriculture and
 nutrition, and separately between footwear and leather tanning, which both
 require knowledge of leather crafting.
 In this case, my algorithm would identify two knowledge markets, one given
 by the agriculture and food manufacturing sectors, and one given by leather
 crafting sectors, leaving the laundry services sector isolated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This example makes clear the importance of identifying separate knowledge
 market to analyze the effects of the evolution of product markets on the
 allocation of inventors.
 In this figure, where there are routinely almost no links of the laundry
 sectors to the others, we would not observe a response of the inventor
 distribution to changes in the concentration of these sectors, since the
 other inventors in the economy specialize on different skills set and would
 therefore not be able to transition there.
 Analogously, we would expect a higher profitability in footwear manufacturing
 to attract inventors away from leather tanning, but not from vegetable
 farming.

Note: This Figure provides a graphical illustration of the definition of
 knowledge markets as sets of product markets sharing the same required
 knowledge to innovate.
 This illustration is based on transitions of inventors across product markets
 observed in my data and classified in the same knowledge markets, although
 many other sectors in these markets are excluded for the sake of exposition.
 In the figure, nodes represent NAICS sectors 1111 (Oilseed and Grain Farming),
 1112 (Vegetable and Melon Farming), 3111 (Animal Food Manufacturing), 3161
 (Leather and Hide Tanning and Finishing), 3162 (Footwear Manufacturing),
 and 8123 (Drycleaning and Laundry Services).
 The edges connecting nodes represent inventor transitions across sectors,
 while the width of these edges represents the strength of the connection
 between the two sectors as measured by undirected inventor flows.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Measuring Inventor Transitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step to construct knowledge markets consists in defining transitions
 of inventors across sectors.
 I employ the USPTO patent data classified into 4-digit NAICS sectors by
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "goldschlagAlgorithmicLinksProbabilities2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to do so.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Data"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 exemplifies the structure of the USPTO dataset matched with this NAICS
 classification.
 In this dataset, each patent is listed together with all the inventors
 listed in the registered patents.
 Each inventor is assigned a disambiguated ID corresponding to the serial
 number of the first patent the inventor appears.
 In this example, inventor 00001-1 and 00001-2 both cooperate on the development
 of patent US00001.
 The third column in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Data"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 shows an example of the 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "goldschlagAlgorithmicLinksProbabilities2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 classification for NAICS 4-digit industries.
 The authors conduct a text analysis to classify each patent into the various
 NAICS sectors of application of that patent.
 As the table illustrates, this classification is not limited to a single
 sector per patent, and includes multiple sectors in almost all instances.
 Importantly, this classification captures the 
\emph on
technological nature
\emph default
 of the patent and the sectors of application of the knowledge required
 to develop that patent.
 While other classifications, like the CPC or the USPC, also describe the
 technological nature of patents, they do not allow a direct match to sectors
 of application without arbitrarily assigning sectors to each of these classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given this data structure, I define a transition in two ways.
 First, I consider inventor transitions 
\emph on
within patents.
 
\emph default
That is, I consider that an inventor transition occurs between two sectors
 if an inventor works on a patent that applies to both of these sectors.
 The direction of flows does not matter for the definition of knowledge
 markets, since I am interested in grouping sectors which exchange researchers
 and not in the specific direction of these exchanges.
 Therefore in the case of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Data"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, I would say that there have been two transitions between sectors 1111
 and 1112 in 1980.
 Another type of transition that I consider is 
\emph on
across patents
\emph default
.
 This transition occurs when an inventor works on different patents that
 apply to different product markets.
 An example of such transition in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Data"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, is the transition between sector 1112 and 3111 by inventor 00001-1.
 The raw count of transitions of inventors across sectors in each year constitut
es the basis of my measure of inventor flows.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Weighting Inventor Flows: Effective Inventors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After identifying transitions, I proceed to weigh them by two alternative
 measures in order to quantify the flow of inventors across sectors.
 The first measure simply weigh each transition equally, computing inventor
 flows as the raw count of researchers moving across NAICS.
 The second measure adjusts for the productivity of individual inventors,
 since raw counts might overstate or understate the importance of each transitio
n, depending on the size of origin and destination sectors, their technological
 nature, as well as the ability of each inventor.
 I therefore define a measure of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

effective inventors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that aims to correct for these and other omitted factors.
 For each inventor, I estimate the fixed effect, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i},$
\end_inset

 in the fully-saturated regression,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\text{\#Patents}_{cfit} & =\alpha_{i}+\gamma_{cft}+\varepsilon_{cfit},\label{eq:one-1-1}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\#Patents}_{cfit}$
\end_inset

 denotes the number of patents registered in CPC class, 
\begin_inset Formula $c,$
\end_inset

 firm (assignee), 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, and year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, that include inventor 
\begin_inset Formula $i.$
\end_inset

 In this regression 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{cft}$
\end_inset

 denotes a of CPC class by firm (assignee) by year fixed effect.
 I choose to include indicators for CPC classes at one digit, the broadest
 classification, in order to identify as many fixed effects as possible.
 The inclusion of CPC, firm, and year controls corrects for specific technologic
al features of the patented technology, the firm environment, as well as
 the specific year.
 Further, this specification produces an estimate of inventor productivity
 that accounts for the number of collaborators on each patent.
 Clearly, these fixed effects might be inconsistently estimated, and for
 this reason I check the robustness of all my results, including the constructio
n of knowledge markets, to the use of the raw count of inventors rather
 than the inventor's productivity captured by the fixed effect, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Given this specification, I define an 
\emph on
effective inventor
\emph default
 as one unit of the resulting fixed effects, rescaled to take nonnegative
 values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Armed with the results of this estimate, I define 
\emph on
effective inventor flows
\emph default
 between sector 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and sector 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
flow_{j\rightarrow k,t} & =\sum_{i}\#\left\{ \text{\ensuremath{i\text{'s}\ \text{transitions}\ j\rightarrow k\text{ \ensuremath{\text{in}} }t}}\right\} \cdot\alpha_{i},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

that is, the sum of transition counts weighted by effective inventors.
 The total undirected flow between two sectors is then given by the sum
 of inflows and outflows with ends in one of the two sectors:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
flow_{jk}=\sum_{t}\left(flow_{j\rightarrow k,t}+flow_{k\rightarrow j,t}\right).
\]

\end_inset

This flow measure defines a network of inventor transitions across product
 markets, where the nodes, 
\begin_inset Formula $j,k$
\end_inset

, are given by 4-digit NAICS codes, edges are given by transitions across
 sectors, and edge weights are defined as a rescaled version of 
\begin_inset Formula $flow_{jk}.$
\end_inset

 I use these edge weights as a measure of the strength of the connection
 between pairs of sectors in the network.
 Rescaling the flow measure is necessary in order to exclude effects of
 sector size as well as to avoid double counting of inventors.
 I describe how I rescale this series in Appendix

Community Detection and Resulting Knowledge Markets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I used rescaled the rescaled undirected flow measure as a network edge weight
 to identify communities through the Louvain algorithm developed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "blondelFastUnfoldingCommunities2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This procedure maximizes the modularity of the network choosing the number
 of communities (knowledge market) and the assignment of nodes (NAICS sectors)
 to communities.
 Modularity, a commonly used measure of connectedness of networks, measures
 the distance between the density of links 
\emph on
within 
\emph default
communities versus 
\emph on
between.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This procedures produces 10 non-singleton sets of NAICS 4-digit sectors
 that share the same inventors and have non-missing concentration measures.
 By construction of the community detection algorithm, these knowledge markets
 do not overlap, so each NAICS 4-digit sector belongs to one and only one
 knowledge market.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 displays the result of my procedure applied to NAICS 3-digit sectors.
 I report this exercise since the 4-digit equivalent would be unreadable.
 However, the knowledge markets identified by the two exercises are qualitativel
y similar although they are clearly more numerous in the 4-digit case.
 In this figure,
\size footnotesize
 
\size default
lines denote inventor transitions, with width proportional to the effective
 undirected inventor flow between sectors.
 Nodes represent the NAICS 3-digit sectors reported on each node.
 Black lines depict flows within knowledge markets, while gray lines represent
 transitions between communities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three features are worth emphasizing.
 First, the network is very dense, and transitions across 3-digit as well
 as 2-digit sectors are pervasive, and differ largely in intensity.
 This points to the relevance of this classification and its stark difference
 from what could be obtained by grouping sectors based on broad product
 markets, which would neglect the linkages across disparate markets, as
 well as pooling all sectors together, which would neglect the difference
 in the strength of inventor flows.
 Second, while the flows between communities might seem more numerous than
 within communities, this is solely a by-product of the circular layout
 of the network, whereby flows within close communities on the circle are
 masked by the nodes.
 When applying the algorithm to 4-digit sectors, I find that less than a
 third of flows occur between communities, as expected since the community
 detection algorithm maximizes the density of within-community linkages.
 Third, and perhaps most importantly, the classification that I obtain is
 sensible, grouping together sectors that we might expect to share similar
 knowledge to innovate.
 Starting from sector 111 and going counter-clockwise, the knowledge markets
 in the Figure can be described as follows.
 The first market, including sector 111, groups sectors involving agricultural
 production (111, 112 and 114) as well as food manufacturing (311).
 The second market, starting with 211, includes oil, gas, and mining.
 The green cluster at the top of the figure groups several heavy manufacturing
 industries, like chemicals plastics and petroleum products, as well as
 pipeline transportation (486).
 The market in yellow is concerned mostly with transportation services and
 manufacturing as well as motor vehicle dealers.
 The large blue cluster collects a large number of retail sectors, as well
 as data processing, telecom and broadcasting services.
 The remaining three markets include insurance and finance (red cluster),
 computer, electronics, and machinery manufacturing and professional services
 (violet), and wholesalers (gray).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowledge markets are identified using my measure of effective inventors,
 but the algorithm produces nearly identical results when using raw inventor
 counts; over 97% of 4-digit NAICS pairs of sectors are classified in the
 same manner using the two measures.
 That is, 97% of sector pairs belong to the same knowledge market according
 to both measures.

Patent Citation Measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each patent classified by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "goldschlagAlgorithmicLinksProbabilities2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I count the set of cited patents that belong to the citing patent's assignee.
 In the case of cited patents with multiple assignees, I consider half a
 count if the assignee is among them.
 The share of self-citation is given by this count divided by total citations.
 I construct five measures to correct self-citations for the assignee's
 importance in the relevant technology class of cited patents.
 For each citation made, excess self-citations are defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $1-Pr\left(\text{self-citation}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The various measures differ on how the probability of self-citation is
 computed.
 For the first three measures, I compute this probability as the assignee's
 share of total patents in the NAICS code attributed to the citing patent.
 In employ in turn the share of NAICS patents in the year, the previous
 five years, and the cumulative share from the beginning of the sample.
 The other two measures are based on the CPC classification at the group
 and subgroup levels (the lowest levels of detail in the classification).
 For this measure, the probability of self-citation is constructed for each
 citation by taking the share of patents by the assignee in the CPC (sub)group
 and year corresponding to the cited patents.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Finally, I aggregate all measures across assignees in the same NAICS 4-digit
 code using the number of patents in the relevant NAICS code by each assignee
 in each year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I also construct truncation-corrected two forward citation measures and
 a patent generality measures following the definitions and the procedures
 described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hallNBERPatentCitation2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The forward citation measures compute the average number of citations received
 by each firm's patents, giving an indication of the importance of each
 patent for future technological developments.
 The correction for truncation is conducted estimating the empirical CDF
 of the forward citations lag distribution of patents in the relevant CPC
 2-digit technology class.
 The correction is then carried out by dividing the overall amount of forward
 citations at the latest available date by the inverse of the CDF thus obtained.
 The procedure suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hallNBERPatentCitation2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 uses only information pertaining to the CPC 2-digit technology class of
 the cited patent.
 In addition to this measure, I also conduct an alternative correction that
 estimates a separate distribution for each citing CPC 2-digit class and
 sums the corrected forward citations across all citing classes.
 Patent generality also measures the technological impact of patents, but
 rather than focusing on citations it examines the scope of application
 of the patent.
 In particular, it computes a measure of the dispersion of citation received
 across different CPC classes.
 The higher is this dispersion, the wider is the technological applicability
 of the patent.

Regulation Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mercatus RegData provides a count of restrictions imposed on a number of
 NAICS 4d-digit product markets, obtained by matching a set of keywords
 in NAICS descriptions to regulatory texts, and then taking the best match
 for each document.
 However, the available data does not include a set of codes for data quality
 reasons.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Therefore, I process the description of NAICS 4d codes and compute the cosine-si
milarity between all pairs of sectors.
 I build an estimate of sector-relevant restrictions for missing sectors
 by taking an average weighted by cosine similarity of sectors included
 in RegData.
 In particular, I include in the average the five most similar NAICS codes
 if similarity is larger than .2, and I attribute the regulations of the
 most similar sector otherwise.
 I chose this threshold by inspecting the similarity associated to various
 NAICS pairs, and the assignment of regulations to sectors is not highly
 sensitive to this choice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Inventor Distribution Measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I employ the measure of effective inventors constructed as detailed above
 to compute measures of researchers' concentration within sectors for each
 year in my sample.
 Specifically, I use the PatentsView assignee ID to identify firms that
 employ specific inventors in each sector, and then compute several measures
 of the concentration of inventors within sectors.
 I focus in particular on the top 10% and bottom 50% share of inventors,
 as well as other commonly employed measures of dispersion like the ratio
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $90^{th}$
\end_inset

 quantile to the median.
 I also compute the Gini coefficient of inventors across CPC classes and
 NAICS 4-digit, assigning effective inventors to the relevant technology
 class or NAICS sector, to document the trend in increasing concentration
 of inventors in specific patent classes and sectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Aggregation at Census Frequency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data from the Economic Census are available at five-year frequency for the
 years 1997-2017, which requires aggregating the other data at the same
 frequency.
 Since I am interested in the effect of concentration on the allocation
 of inventors, I average all variables related to inventors and productivity
 using the five-year window 
\emph on
starting 
\emph default
in the census year (e.g., 1997-2001 for 1997), while I use concentration measures
 for the related census year.
 In the IV regression I use product restrictions as an instrument for concentrat
ion, which motivates me to average restrictions in the five-year window
 
\emph on
ending
\emph default
 in the census year (e.g., 1993-1997 for 1997).
 Since 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Section
Empirical Analysis
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Results"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section presents four main findings that apply to the period 1997-2012:
 (i) effective inventors have become more concentrated across economic sectors;
 (ii) sectors with increased concentration have attracted a growing share
 of relevant inventor types; (iii) growth in the share of relevant inventors
 is negatively correlated with inventor productivity, as measured by forward
 citations as well as average growth in output per worker divided by effective
 inventors employed; and (iv) growth in the share of relevant inventors
 is positively correlated with the share of self-citations and excess self-citat
ions, as well as concentration of inventors at the top within sectors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results (i) and (ii) are indicative of a growing concentration of inventors,
 and establish a positive causal link between the growth in product market
 concentration and the increase in sectors' inventor share.
 Findings (iii) and (iv) provide evidence in favor of misallocation.
 Inventors' concentration in less competitive sectors turns out to be inefficien
t, since there researchers are predominantly employed on projects that do
 not contribute to the growth of the sector, which I interpret as defensive
 innovation.
 This interpretation is supported by the concentration of inventors among
 larger firms, the decline in forward citations received by patents obtained
 by these firms, and the decrease in growth per inventor that accompanies
 the increase in product market concentration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of this section proceeds as follows.
 The first subsection presents my empirical framework and variable definition.
 Remaining sections present in order results (i)-(iv) above.
 I discuss the causal interpretation of my results an IV specification in
 Subsection

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Variable Definitions and Main Specification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main outcomes of interest throughout the analysis refer to measures
 of inventors concentration or measures of R&D productivity.
 For the former, I rely on the definition of effective inventors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

, provided in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:KnowledgeMarkets"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, that is productivity-adjusted inventors.
 For each product market, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, I define the share of inventors employed by the sector in year 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Inventor\ Share}{}_{p,t}\equiv\frac{\sum_{p(i,t)=p}\alpha_{i}}{\sum_{k(i,t)=k}\alpha_{i}},
\]

\end_inset

where the sum at the numerator is taken over all effective inventors that
 are mentioned in patents registered in product market 
\begin_inset Formula $p,$
\end_inset

 while the denominator computes the total effective inventors that belong
 to the knowledge market.
 Effective inventors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i},$
\end_inset

 are also the measure I use to evaluate the dispersion of inventors across
 sectors and technology classes.
 My results are robust to computing the inventor share using raw counts
 of researchers instead of effective inventors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When analyzing R&D productivity I focus on the three patent-based measures
 described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Other data and aggregation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, that is, forward citations, share of self-citations, and patent generality.
 Further, I compute a more direct measure of the productivity of inventors
 given by the growth in output per worker divided by the number of effective
 inventors employed by the sector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In most specifications, the independent variables are measures of concentration
 and controls for the size of the sector considered.
 As discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Data-Sources"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, my baseline measure of concentration is the lower bound of the Herfindal-Hirsc
hman Index constructed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "keilTroubleApproximatingIndustry2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 using top sales share reported by the Economic Census for each sector.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The expression used to obtain this measure is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{\ensuremath{\underbar{HHI}}}_{p,t} & =4\left[\frac{\text{CR4}_{p,t}}{4}\right]^{2}+4\left[\frac{\text{CR8}_{p,t}-\text{CR4}_{p,t}}{4}\right]^{2}+12\left[\frac{\text{CR20}_{p,t}-\text{CR8}_{p,t}}{12}\right]^{2}+30\left[\frac{\text{CR50}_{p,t}-\text{CR20}_{p,t}}{30}\right]^{2},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CR{X}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 denotes the concentration ratio, that is the share of sales, of the top
 X firms.
 This measure is a lower bound, and coincides with the actual HHI if the
 sector has less than 50 firms, and sales share are distributed equally
 in each of the top 0-4, 5-8, 9-20, 21-50 brackets.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 reports a correlation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\ensuremath{\underbar{HHI}}}$
\end_inset

 with the actual index of 0.93.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 I label this variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\text{HHI}}_{p,t}$
\end_inset

, where the line below stands for the lower bound.
 This choice is motivated by the small number of sectors in my sample that
 have an HHI index reported by the Economic Census (about 80).
 Using the lower bound I can extend my analysis to a total of 157 sectors.
 Due to the high correlation between the two variables, the results are
 robust to using the Economic Census HHI, as shown in robustness exercises.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I obtain sales variable from the Economic Census, which I deflate using
 BLS NAICS-specific price indexes.
 I use sales variables for two purposes.
 First, real sales in 2012 as the weight in my regressions.
 Second, I use the logarithm real sales as well as a quartic in real sales
 in order to control for changes in the size of sectors during my sample
 period.
 For the selected subset of sectors that reports the number of establishments,
 I also explore the robustness of my findings to controlling for sales per
 establishment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given these definitions, my main specification is a sector-level long-difference
 regression over the period 1997-2012:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta\text{Share}_{p,\ 2012-1997}=f_{k}\mathbf{1}\left\{ p\in k\right\} \ +\ \beta\Delta\underline{\text{HHI}}_{p,\ 2012-1997}\ +\ \gamma'\Delta\text{Size}_{p,\ 2012-1997}\ +\ \varepsilon_{p},\label{eq: spec}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\text{Share}$
\end_inset

denotes the change in the inventors' share of product market 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{k}\mathbf{1}\left\{ p\in k\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a dummy variable that takes value 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 if the product market, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, belongs to knowledge, 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\underline{\text{HHI}}$
\end_inset

 is the change in the HHI lower bound, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\text{Size}$
\end_inset

 is a set of controls for the size of sector 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, which are given by either the change in the logarithm of real sales or
 real sales per firm, or the change in the terms of a quadratic polynomial
 in the real sales of the sector.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regressions are weighted by sector sales in 2012 for the findings which
 rely on Economic Census sector-level measures, and I estimate robust standard
 errors in all specifications.
 When looking at patent measures, I employ the same specification as 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: spec"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, where I replace the outcome variable with the change in patent productivity
 and the dependent variable with the change in inventors' share.
 In this case, since I do not rely on Economic Census measures, I report
 unweighted regressions.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As I will show, the change in the inventor share is highly correlated with
 the change in the HHI, so this specification essentially amounts to a rescaling
 of the coefficient that would be obtained using the HHI.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Inventor Concentration across NAICS Sectors has Increased

\begin_layout Standard
Figure

 series is available.
 I construct these series using the share of effective inventors (in panel

 I use the HHI index of inventor shares accruing to each sector as a measure
 of concentration.
 Both panels display an increasing trend in the concentration of inventors
 starting from the late 1990s.
 These patterns align closely with the trends reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "akcigitWhatHappenedBusiness2019a"

, which document a rising share of patents registered by top firms within
 sectors.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 extends this findings to the cross-industry allocation of inventors.
 Quantitatively, the increase in inventor concentration is sizable, correspondin
g to about a 20% increase in the HHI for the effective inventor measure
 over the period 1997-2012.
 Using raw inventor counts increases this number to 30%.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the other results presented below, the effective inventor measure
 and the raw inventor count behave similarly, albeit the series for raw
 counts is more volatile and exhibits larger changes.
 This difference in volatility stems from the regression method implied
 to obtain effective inventors, which accounts for several features through
 time, firm, and technology class fixed effects.

Markets with Growing Concentration Increased Their Inventor Share

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, I present three sets of results for each specification,
 which differ in the estimation sample to account for extreme observations.
 In regression tables, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Full Sample
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refers to the sample of observations with non-missing observations for
 all the variables included.
 I propose two sample selections to rule out that outliers drive the baseline
 results.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Trim Outliers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refer to a sample which trims the most extreme observations for the outcome
 and the independent variable separately.
 I trim the observations that fall beyond three standard deviations from
 the sample average of each variable, and that are most likely to drive
 the results estimated using the full sample.

Mahalanobis 5%
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 denotes the sample where I trim the 5% extreme observations based on the
 Mahalanobis distance of pairs of observations from the data centroid.
 Since this procedure is based on the joint distribution of the outcome

Table

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 where the outcome variable is the change in knowledge-market inventor share,
 and the independent variable is the change in the lower bound of the Herfindal-
Hirschman Index discussed above, or the index as reported by the Economic
 Census.
 The results in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 highlight a strongly significant positive correlation between the change
 in the HHI and the change in the share of effective inventors accruing
 to each NAICS sector.
 Note that this regression is only partially driven by the contemporaneous
 correlation between the two variables.
 As discussed above, the share of effective inventors is average over the
 five years 
\emph on
starting 
\emph default
in the Economic Census year, while the concentration measures refer to the
 Economic Census year only.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two important notes on the scale of the variables are in order.
 First, here and in all following tables and graphs, all variables which
 refer to shares or growth rates are reported in percentage points for ease
 of interpretation.
 Therefore, for example the coefficient in Column (1) of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvNoctrl"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 should be interpreted as saying that an increase in one unit of the HHI
 index leads to an increase in the share of the relevant knowledge market
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $27.25$
\end_inset

 pp.
 Second, HHI indices are instead constructed to range between 0 and 1.
 In particular, the HHI lower bound has sales-weighted an average of about
 .03, and a standard deviation of .032 in 2012.
 According to Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvNoctrl"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, a standard deviation increase in this measure is associated to a 0.87 pp
 increase in the share of inventors accruing to the relevant NAICS sector.
 In comparison, the sales-weighted average share of inventors in 2012 is
 1.18%, with a standard deviation of 1.82%, so the estimated effect of a one
 standard deviation increase in concentration corresponds to about half
 a standard deviation increase in the share of inventors in the relevant
 market.
 Clearly, the estimates using the HHI lower bound tend to be noisier as
 this is a constructed, and therefore imprecise, measure of concentration.
 However, the number of available observations is much larger than the actual
 HHI, allowing me to extend my findings to a larger number of sectors (about
 double as can be seen from the number of observations in each specification).

\begin_layout Standard
While suggestive, the correlation presented above is far from causal, as
 it neglects two fundamental components.
 First, it does not include controls for the size of the sectors or firms,
 which could have a confounding and mechanical effect on the share of scientists
 accruing to a specific sector.
 Second, it estimates the correlation both across and within knowledge markets.
 In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvHHI"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, I address these two limitations by restricting the analysis within knowledge
 markets, and controlling for two measures of size.
 In the upper panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvHHI"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, I use the change in the logarithm of real sales as a measure of the size
 of each sector, while in the lower panel I present the results when average
 sales per firm are included as a control.
 The inclusion of sales per firm is motivated by the fact that there might
 be significant barriers to entry to R&D, easier to overcome for larger
 firms, mechanically linking concentration and inventor hiring.
 Since the Economic Census reports the number of companies only for a subset
 of firms, the sample used in the lower panel is smaller than the upper
 panel.
 The results in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvHHI"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 confirm the positive relation between the change in inventor shares and
 concentration, and are largely unchanged relative to the estimates in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvNoctrl"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, suggesting that the correlation does not arise mechanically from factors
 related to firm or sector size.
 In particular, these findings imply that sectors with increasing concentration
 have attracted a rising share of scientists above what would be implied
 by their expansion in overall sales as well as average firm size.

, Panel (a).
 The upper panel portrays changes of knowledge-market inventor shares over
 the change in the HHI lower bound, after partialling out fixed effects
 for the relevant knowledge market and changes in log real sales, with the
 marker size proportional to the regression weight.
 Although the sample displays some observations that appear extreme, the
 bulk of observations—and especially weighted observations—falls on the
 regression lines, mitigating the concerns that a few outliers might drive
 the results.
 In any event, I explore the robustness of the results to the exclusion
 of non-residualized observations, both manually and defining extreme observatio
ns based on the Mahalanobis distance.
 Importantly, this exercise reveals that the observations that appear extreme
 in the residualized scatter are not unusual when considering the marginal
 or joint distribution of non-residualized outcome and independent variable.
 The bottom panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 reports the binned scatter plot corresponding to the sample where the 5%
 extreme observations according to the Mahalanobis distance have been removed,
 and confirms that the positive relation between concentration and inventor
 shares is not driven by a few extreme observations.
 In particular, the corresponding regression results in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvHHI"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

(a), Column (6), show that the estimated coefficient is significant at a
 5% confidence level.
 The results presented in this section are robust to using the raw number
 of inventors to compute the share of researchers captured by each product
 market.

\begin_layout Standard
Appendix Table

LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegTotShare"

 shows estimates using the share of effective inventors of each product
 market over the total.
 This amounts to neglecting the fact that inventors flow only across sectors
 that can employ their skills.
 In this specification, I find a significant, albeit small, effect of product
 market concentration on the share of inventors.
 However, this result only arises when the sample is trimmed to remove outliers.
 This is unsurprising in light of the discussion in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:KnowledgeMarkets"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, whereby mismeasuring the labor market for inventors should bias the estimates
 of inventor mobility towards zero, since many of the sectors would actually
 not be routinely connected by inventor flows.
 Finally, this result also conforms with the findings in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvHHI"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 the coefficients significantly, suggesting that flows across knowledge
 markets are indeed negligible.

\begin_layout Paragraph
IV Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I now present IV results that suggest that the relation between concentration
 and inventor shares is causal.
 Indeed, more concentration might just be the result of an increase in technolog
ical entry barriers, established by incumbents through an increase in their
 R&D inventors.
 In this scenario, the causality would flow from increased inventor shares
 to higher concentration.
 Above, I tried to mitigate this concern using the the average share of
 inventors following the Economic Census years to which the HHI refers as
 my outcome variable.
 However, reverse causality could still be present if the autocorrelation
 of inventor shares is sufficiently high.
 This motivates me to produce 2SLS estimates that instrument the change
 in the HHI lower bound with changes in product market restrictions, as
 measured by the Mercatus dataset RegData 4.0.
 Theoretically, an increase in restrictions should raise barriers to entry
 in affected product markets, thus leading to higher concentration.
 As discussed below, this proves to be the case empirically, making a case
 for the validity of restrictions as an instrument for concentration.
 A violation of the exclusion restriction requires a causal connection between
 product market regulations and the share of inventors hired by each sector,
 which acts independently of product market concentration.
 A possibility in this sense is the increase in the number of inventors
 required to fulfill product market restrictions, if such regulations specifical
ly affect technologies currently in use in the industry.
 However, this effect should be both large and persistent to be captured
 by my measure of inventor shares.
 Further, while RegData certainly include product restrictions, there are
 also a number of regulatory burdens that are not related to technological
 components, like reporting obligations and other legal burdens.
 In addition, while product restrictions might certainly induce a change
 in the direction of innovation, there is no a priori reason to believe
 that the scale of innovation activity should also increase.
 These considerations lead me to believe that the exclusion restriction
 is not highly likely to be violated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of the 2SLS estimation are presented in the upper panel of Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegIV"

 The specification is the same as in Column (2) of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvHHI"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, including both knowledge market and sale change fixed effects.
 The 2SLS estimates confirm the significance of concentration changes for
 the increase in knowledge market inventor shares.
 The magnitudes of estimated coefficients are statistically indistinguishable
 from the ones reported in the baseline regression.
 The first-stage F clearly indicates that instruments are weak.
 This is unsurprising since, as detailed above, both the HHI lower bound
 and the regulation measures are constructed and therefore imprecise.
 In particular, I had to impute regulations for a large part of the sample
 using the cosine-similarity between product market restrictions.

 The results in the lower panel of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 imply that the first-stage t-statistic for the regression of the change
 in the HHI lower bound over log-regulations is 2.07, which corresponds to
 a p-value of 0.041.
 The reduced form regression of inventor share over log restriction change
 is equally highly significant.
 Accordingly, the SW underidentification test rejects the null hypothesis
 at a 5% confidence level.
 Given the weakness of the instruments, I also report the Anderson-Rubin
 p-value, which confirms that the coefficient is 5% significant, and the
 corresponding confidence intervals in brackets.

While the findings presented so far establish a connection between inventor

 the distribution of researchers across sectors are inefficient.
 In particular, it would not be unreasonable to think that more concentrated

 incumbents.

 offers a step in this direction, showing that the increase in inventor
 concentration is positively correlated with the increase in self-citations
 within the affected sectors.
 This relation is apparent when restricting attention to the middle range
 of changes in inventor shares, reported in the Panel (b).
 The the full sample present some extreme observations with little change
 in self-citations that drive the estimated coefficient towards 0.
 When restricting to the middle range of the change in inventor shares,
 which amounts to dropping less than 10% extreme observations, a strong
 positive correlation emerges between change in inventor shares and excess
 citations.
 Importantly, the measures of excess self-citations that I construct account
 for the contribution of active firms to technological advances in the relevant
 CPC classifications, thus excluding a mechanical increase in self-citations
 that would result solely from a reduction in R&D activity by competing
 firms.
 That is, if a firm contributes 100% of the relevant patents to a filed
 and cites itself only, its excess self-citations are 0, as explained in
 Section

 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows that the opposite is occurring.
 Specifically, the share of effective inventors accruing to top inventor-hiring
 firms has increased in the sectors that attracted more inventors over the
 period considered, relative to firms with less inventors in the sector.
 This finding is consistent across a variety of measures displayed in Columns
 (1) to (6).
 These findings suggest that inventors have increasingly concentrated among
 large incumbents, that is, sectors that increased their inventor share
 also saw a 
\emph on

 increase in inventor concentration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout this section, I present results using changes in inventor shares
 to focus directly on the correlation between inventor transitions and their
 within-sector distribution.
 Unless otherwise noted, these findings are robust to using the change in
 the HHI rather than the inventor share, as should be expected from the
 strong correlation between these two variables reported in previous tables.
 For this section, and other patent-based measure, I present robustness
 results employing this alternative specification in Appendix

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My next finding suggests that this trend might be driven by a rise in defensive
 innovation, that is R&D aimed at sheltering the incumbents' dominant position
 and raising barriers to entry.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 shows that inventors' concentration in specific sectors has gone hand in
 hand with a fall in patents' forward citations in these sectors, a standard
 measure of the impact of patents and their role in paving the way for further
 innovations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hallNBERPatentCitation2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The result in Columns (1) and (2) report two different measures of forward
 citations, that differ in how the series are corrected for truncation.
 As discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Other data and aggregation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, one measure (Column (2)) uses the procedure delineated by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hallNBERPatentCitation2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, computing the forward citation lag distribution conditioning on the technology
 class of the cited patent, while the other (Column (1)) also conditions
 on the technology class of citing patents.
 Column (3) presents the estimates relative to patent generality, another
 measure of patent impact, which increases with the scope of application
 of the patent.
 The regressions in this table are unweighted since they rely only on patent
 data, but results are robust to using the HHI as a regressor and weighting
 by sales.
 I present results for the full sample, as well as restricting to the middle
 range of changes in inventor shares, which contains more than 90% of the
 observations.
 In both samples, I find a highly significant negative relation between
 changes in inventor shares and the fall in forward citations.
 The coefficients imply a high semi-elasticity of self citations to changes
 in the inventor shares, whereby a 1pp increase in the share of inventors
 leads to an average 0.2-0.5% reduction in forward citations.
 When dropping extreme observations, I also find a significant decrease
 in the generality of the patents, indicating that concentrating sectors
 produce less widely applicable patents.
 This effect is however not robust to estimating the regression using the
 HHI as the independent variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fall in forward citations is a first indication of the presence of defensive
 innovation, aimed primarily at barring entrants from developing new technologie

 In the next section, I show that these patents also appear to produce limited
 benefits in terms of ensuing productivity growth, as measured by output
 per worker growth.
 This provides further support to my interpretation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before moving to the results on productivity, I investigate a competing
 explanation for my findings on output growth.
 As highlighted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and

\end_inset

 among others, large incumbents have a strong incentive to focus on improving
 their own products at the expense of broadly applicable innovation.
 In the words of the authors, internal and incremental innovation prevails
 on more radical, external innovations.
 This mechanism would also imply that an increase in incumbents' share of
 R&D resources leads to falling innovation productivity.
 In order to asses the importance of this channel, and in keeping with the
 analysis in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "akcigitGrowthHeterogeneousInnovations2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, I use the share of self-citations to measure the extent of internal innovation
 conducted by firms.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegSelfCite"

 displays the results pertaining to this measure.
 All columns use as dependent variable the change in excess log self-citations
 as defined in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Other data and aggregation"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Columns (1) and (2) build excess self-citations correcting for the importance
 of firms' patents for the CPC group, which reflects the technological classific
ation of the patent.
 Columns (3) and (4) use the more narrowly-defined CPC subgroups for robustness.
 Coefficients are mostly non-significant, and turn negative when knowledge
 market fixed effects are included.
 Column (3) displays a marginally significant coefficient.
 However, this result is not robust to using the HHI as regressor and weighting
 regressions by sales as in the baseline specification.
 The findings in this table suggest that incremental innovation does changes
 significantly following changes in sector concentration, reducing the scope
 for this alternative explanation.

 I use growth in annual output per worker provided by the Economic Census

 Census year, and I proceed analogously to build a measure of average effective
 inventors over the same period.
 Inventor productivity is then defined as average output per worker growth

 Both the outcome and the dependent variable are measured in percentage
 points.
 Table

 Using the coefficient in Column (5) to predict the median annual change
 in labor productivity growth implied by rising inventor concentration amounts
 to a fall of .15pp (
\begin_inset Formula $-.005\times.014pp\times2018$
\end_inset

).
 This number increases to .
 28pp when using the statistics relative to sectors with positive growth
 in labor productivity only, which accounted for the bulk of the increase
 in inventor shares.
 An alternative back-of-the-envelope computation, using the change in product
 market concentration to predict the change in inventor shares gives even
 starker results.
 Using the coefficient in Column (2) of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab: RegShInvHHI"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

(a), and considering a median change in the HHI of 0.002 yields an increase
 in the share of effective inventors in concentrating sectors of 0.045pp,
 which implies a fall in average labor productivity implied by misallocation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.45$
\end_inset

pp.
 While these numbers might appear sizable considering the entirety of the
 economy, it is worth noting that the sample I have data for includes mainly
 manufacturing and retail sectors, which experienced a sizable reduction
 of about 
\begin_inset Formula $2.8$
\end_inset

pp in average annual productivity growth from 1997-2012, driven by a steep
 decline in output per worker growth in manufacturing.
 Therefore, the mechanism I propose would explain around 15% of the observed
 decrease in output per worker growth in these sectors.

The estimates in the lower panel of Table

 variable, imply even larger growth effects.
 Using the estimates in Column (2), a median HHI change of 0.02 and a median
 number of effective inventors of 1421 in sectors with growth in inventor
 shares implies a 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.78$

 interval ranging from 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.13$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $-1.45$

 The midpoint of these estimates would explain 
\begin_inset Formula $27\%$

 with bounds ranging from around 
\begin_inset Formula $5\%$
\end_inset

 to about 
\begin_inset Formula $50\%$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This last set of results provides further support to the hypothesis that
 defensive innovation increased in concentrating sectors.
 Indeed, a central feature of this type of R&D activity is that it does
 not produce substantial growth, since it is aimed at hampering innovation
 projects by potential entrants.
 In this sense, patents are registered in order to prevent others from doing
 so and implementing inventions that would threaten the incumbents' dominant
 position.
 This interpretation also resonates with the finding in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, who note that incumbent firms tend to register a large number of patents,
 but account for a small share of overall innovations; a finding they also
 interpret as evidence of defensive innovation.
