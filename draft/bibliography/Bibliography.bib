Using novel revenue data for tens of thousands of patents held by non-practicing entities (NPEs), we find that the relationship between citations and value forms an inverted-U, with fewer citations at the high end of value than in the middle. We explain the inverted-U with a model of innovation that has productive and strategic patents. Empirically, we observe more strategic patents where the model predicts: among inventors in fields of rapid development and where divisional applications are employed. These findings have important implications for our understanding of growth, innovation, intellectual property policy, and patent valuation.},

Understanding how new products and processes are created and how to value them is critical to fields as diverse as industrial organization, endogenous growth theory, and intellectual property law. In this paper we provide the first evidence that much of the work in these literatures is based on an erroneous assumption: that the value of innovation is proportional to citationweighted patent counts. Using a proprietary dataset with patent-specific revenues, we find that there is an inverted-U relationship between patent value and citations. We attempt to explain this relationship using a simple model of firms, allowing for both productive and defensive patents. Simulations from the model match the empirical regularity that some very high-value patents receive substantially fewer citations than less valuable patents. Further, we find evidence of greater use of defensive patenting along the dimensions where it is predicted. These findings have important implications for our basic understanding of growth, innovation, and intellectual property policy.},

  abstract = {Despite the rapid pace of innovation in information and communications technologies (ICT) and electronics, aggregate US productivity growth has been disappointing since the 1970s. We propose and empirically explore the hypothesis that this is because of the unbalanced sectoral distribution of innovation over the last several decades. Because an industry's success in innovation depends on complementary innovations among its input suppliers, rapid productivity growth in just a subset of sectors may create bottlenecks and fail to translate into commensurate aggregate productivity gains. Using data on input-output linkages, citation linkages, industry productivity growth and patenting, we find evidence in support of this hypothesis: the variance of supplier TFP growth or innovation adversely affects an industry's own TFP growth and innovation. Our estimates suggest that a substantial share of the productivity slowdown in the US and several other industrialized economies can be accounted for by the sizable increase in cross-industry variance of TFP growth and innovation. For example, if the TFP growth variance had remained at the same level as between 1977 and 1987, the US manufacturing productivity would have grown twice as fast in 1997-2007 as it did, reaching a higher level of growth than in 1977-1987 and 1987-1997.},

Firms are heterogeneous in their research productivity, i.e., in the efficiency with which they convert a given set of R\&D inputs into successful innovations and that research productivity is private information. There are non-internalized technological spillovers across firms, but the asymmetric information prevents correcting them in the first best way. We highlight that key parameters for the optimal policies are i) the relative complementarities between observable R\&D investments, unobservable R\&D inputs, and firm research productivity, ii) the dispersion and persistence of firms' research productivities, and iii) the magnitude of technological spillovers across firms. We estimate our model using firmlevel data matched to patent data and quantify the optimal policies. In the data, high research productivity firms get disproportionately higher returns to R\&D investments than lower productivity firms. Very simple innovation policies, such as linear corporate taxes combined with a nonlinear R\&D subsidy \textendash{} that provides lower marginal subsidies at higher R\&D levels \textendash{} can do almost as well as the full unrestricted optimal policies. Our formulas and theoretical and numerical methods are more broadly applicable to the provision of firm incentives in dynamic settings with asymmetric information and spillovers and to firm taxation more generally.},

We show that a particularly striking feature of the productivity slowdown is not so much a lower productivity growth at the global frontier, but rather rising labour productivity at the global frontier coupled with an increasing labour productivity divergence between the global frontier and laggard (non-frontier) firms. This productivity divergence remains after controlling for differences in capital deepening and mark-up behaviour, suggesting that divergence in measured multi-factor productivity (MFP) may in fact reflect technological divergence in a broad sense. This divergence could plausibly reflect the potential for structural changes in the global economy \textendash{} namely digitalisation, globalisation and the rising importance of tacit knowledge \textendash{} to fuel rapid productivity gains at the global frontier. Yet, aggregate MFP performance was significantly weaker in industries where MFP divergence was more pronounced, suggesting that the divergence observed is not solely driven by frontier firms pushing the boundary outward. We contend that increasing MFP divergence \textendash{} and the global productivity slowdown more generally \textendash{} could reflect a slowdown in the diffusion process. This could be a reflection of increasing costs for laggard firms of moving from an economy based on production to one based on ideas. But it could also be symptomatic of rising entry barriers and a decline in the contestability of markets. We find the rise in MFP divergence to be much more extreme in sectors where pro-competitive product market reforms were least extensive, suggesting that policy weaknesses may be stifling diffusion in OECD economies.},

Using a unique data set compiled from the career histories of 10,051 elite life scientists in the U.S., we paint a nuanced picture of mobility. Prolific scientists are more likely to move, but this impulse is constrained by recent NIH funding. The quality of peer environments both near and far is an additional factor that influences mobility decisions. We also identify a significant role for family structure. Scientists appear to be unwilling to move when their children are between the ages of 14-17, and this appears to be more pronounced for mothers than fathers. These results suggest that elite scientists find it costly to disrupt the social networks of their children during adolescence and take these costs into account when making career decisions.},

It is difficult to prescribe what the optimal pace should be, but evidence accumulating from multiple datasets and methodologies suggests that the rate of business startups and the pace of employment dynamism in the US economy has fallen over recent decades and that this downward trend accelerated after 2000. A critical factor in accounting for the decline in business dynamics is a lower rate of business startups and the related decreasing role of dynamic young businesses in the economy. For example, the share of US employment accounted for by young firms has declined by almost 30 percent over the last 30 years. These trends suggest that incentives for entrepreneurs to start new firms in the United States have diminished over time. We do not identify all the factors underlying these trends in this paper but offer some clues based on the empirical patterns for specific sectors and geographic regions.},

Since 2000 the decline in dynamism and entrepreneurship has been accompanied by a decline in high-growth young firms. Prior research has shown that the sustained contribution of business startups to job creation stems from a relatively small fraction of high-growth young firms. The presence of these high-growth young firms contributes to a highly (positively) skewed firm growth rate distribution. In 1999, a firm at the 90th percentile of the employment growth rate distribution grew about 31 percent faster than the median firm. Moreover, the 90-50 differential was 16 percent larger than the 50-10 differential reflecting the positive skewness of the employment growth rate distribution. We show that the shape of the firm employment growth distribution changes substantially in the post-2000 period. By 2007, the 90-50 differential was only 4 percent larger than the 50-10, and it continued to exhibit a trend decline through 2011. The overall decline reflects a sharp drop in the 90th percentile of the growth rate distribution accounted for by the declining share of young firms and the declining propensity for young firms to be high-growth firms.},

In 1980, aggregate markups start to rise from 21\% above marginal cost to 61\% now. The increase is driven mainly by the upper tail of the markup distribution: the upper percentiles have increased sharply. Quite strikingly, the median is unchanged. In addition to the fattening upper tail of the markup distribution, there is reallocation of market share from low- to high-markup firms. This rise occurs mostly within industry. We also find an increase in the average profit rate from 1\% to 8\%. Although there is also an increase in overhead costs, the markup increase is in excess of overhead. We discuss the macroeconomic implications of an increase in average market power, which can account for a number of secular trends in the past four decades, most notably the declining labor and capital shares as well as the decrease in labor market dynamism.},

These assumptions impose strong theoretical restrictions and are often rejected by the data. This paper develops a new method for estimating production functions with factor-augmenting technology. The method does not impose parametric restrictions and generalizes prior approaches that rely on the CES production function. I first extend the canonical Olley-Pakes framework to accommodate factor-augmenting technology. Then, I show how to identify output elasticities based on a novel control variable approach and the optimality of input expenditures. I use this method to estimate output elasticities and markups in manufacturing industries in the US and four developing countries. Neglecting labor-augmenting productivity and imposing parametric restrictions mismeasures output elasticities and heterogeneity in the production function. My estimates suggest that standard models (i) underestimate capital elasticity, and (ii) overestimate labor elasticity. These biases propagate into markup estimates inferred from output elasticities. My estimates point to a much more muted markup growth (about half) in the US manufacturing sector than recent estimates.},

We find that the aggregate markup accounts for about two-thirds of the costs, misallocation accounts for about one-third, and the costs due to inefficient entry are negligible. We evaluate simple policies aimed at reducing the costs of markups. Subsidizing entry is not an effective tool in our model: while more competition reduces individual firms' markups it also reallocates market shares towards larger firms and the net effect is that the aggregate markup hardly changes. Size-dependent policies aimed at reducing concentration can reduce the aggregate markup but have the side effect of greatly increasing misallocation and reducing aggregate productivity.},

We find that new joiners contribute more than long-term employees to innovative activity in the focal firm. Among new firm recruits, we observe that newly hired former university researchers contribute more to innovative activity than newly hired recent graduates or joiners from firms, but only in firms with a high level of absorptive capacity in the form of recent experience of hiring university researchers. We find also that firms' recent experience of hiring university researchers enhances the effect of newly hired recent graduates' contributions to innovation.},

On the basis of a unique ranking of UK institutions that we were able to construct for the period 1982 to 2005, we develop an econometric analysis of the impact of job changes on post mobility performance over three-year and six-year periods, and the overall effect of mobility. Contrary to the assumptions underpinning most policy action in this area, we find no evidence that mobility per se increases academic performance. Mobility to `better' departments has a positive, but not significant impact, while downward mobility reduces researchers' productivity. In most cases, mobility is associated with short-term decrease in performance arguably or most likely due to associated adjustment costs.},

A central problem in the literature is that firm performance is affected by two countervailing ``spillovers'' : a positive effect from technology (knowledge) spillovers and a negative business stealing effects from product market rivals. We develop a general framework incorporating these two types of spillovers and implement this model using measures of a firm's position in technology space and product market space. Using panel data on U.S. firms, we show that technology spillovers quantitatively dominate, so that the gross social returns to R\&D are at least twice as high as the private returns. We identify the causal effect of R\&D spillovers by using changes in federal and state tax incentives for R\&D. We also find that smaller firms generate lower social returns to R\&D because they operate more in technological niches. Finally, we detail the desirable properties of an ideal spillover measure and how existing approaches, including our new Mahalanobis measure, compare to these criteria.},

Firms improve their existing products through internal innovation, while developing new products through external innovation. A novel friction I consider is that it takes time to learn others' technology, which I denote as an imperfect technology spillover. This friction allows firms to defend themselves from competitors by building technological barriers through internal innovation. Increasing foreign competition induces innovation-intensive and thus fast-growing firms to invest more in internal innovation for defensive reasons. At the same time, foreign competition discourages all firms from undertaking external innovation. This shift in innovation cuts the employment growth of innovation-intensive firms, as external innovation generates more quality improvement than internal innovation and requires firms to hire a new set of workers to produce new products. Entry for potential startups is harder as incumbents build higher technological barriers. By using firm-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau integrated with firm-level patent data, I confirm the model's predictions.},

  abstract = {Slow growth over the last decade has prompted policy attention towards increasing R\&D spending, often via the tax system. We examine the impact of R\&D on firm performance, both by the firm's own investments and through positive (and negative) spillovers from other firms. We analyse panel data on US firms over the last three decades, and allow for time-varying spillovers in both technology space (knowledge spillover) and product market space (product market rivalry). We show that the magnitude of R\&D spillovers remains as large in the second decade of the 21st century as it was in the mid 1980s. Since the ratio of the social return to the private return to R\&D is about four to one, this implies that there remains a strong case for public support of R\&D. Positive spillovers appeared to temporarily increase in the 1995\textendash 2004 digital technology boom. We also show how these micro estimates relate to estimates from the endogenous growth literature and give some suggestions for future work.},

While there are many other factors that drive when innovative individuals and innovative companies decide to locate, there are enough firms and workers on the margin that state taxes matter.

High-tech firms cover the fixed cost of R and D out of operating profits and sell output in a market with imperfect competition. Innovation builds on and contributes to firm-specific knowledge. Moreover, there are spillovers among firms. Growth is higher in a more concentrated market provided that market power of firms is not too high. Economic integration between symmetric countries fosters growth, as profit margins decrease with market shares. Integration of production lines and research efforts by mergers or horizontal integration is conducive to growth.},
