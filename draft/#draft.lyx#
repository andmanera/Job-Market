\begin_layout Abstract
\paragraph_spacing single
The rapid productivity gains achieved by technological innovations in the
 
\begin_inset Formula $20^{\text{th}}$
\end_inset

 century have slowed in recent decades.
 This has come at a time of increased market concentration.
 In this paper, I explore how dominant companies in concentrated sectors
 have siphoned off inventors that might have been employed more productively
 in competitive industries.
 For the period 1997-2012, I establish that sectors with rising concentration
 captured a disproportionate share of researchers, while also experiencing
 a decrease in R&D productivity, signaled by falling forward citations and
 slowing growth per inventor.
 Further, sectors with rising inventor shares saw a significant increase
 in patent litigation cases.
 These findings imply that inventors became increasingly misallocated, accountin
g for nearly 30 percent of the decline in the average annual growth rate
 of output per worker over the 15-year study period.
 I show that these results arise naturally in a Schumpeterian growth model
 where monopolistic firms conduct 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

defensive patenting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to hamper competitors' R&D.
 A calibration of this model reveals that a planner interested in maximizing
 growth should allocate R&D tax credits to entrants in high-concentration
 sectors.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Research and Development activities, which are key to innovation and growth,
 have generated increasingly smaller gains in productivity over the last
 few decades 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 A prominent explanation: Technological complexity is making it harder to
 come up with new ideas.
 A less explored alternative is misallocation of R&D resources 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "acemogluInnovationReallocationGrowth2018a,acemogluBottlenecksSectoralImbalances2021"

\end_inset

, a concern that is echoed in policy circles and the press 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "metzTechGiantsAre2017,bassBigTechSwallows2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 At issue, for example, is whether dominant high-tech firms are attracting
 a disproportionate share of highly educated, highly skilled workers at
 the expense of companies in more competitive sectors.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "talentseer2020AITalent2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, 20% of total Artificial Intelligence experts are employed by just five
 big-tech companies: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and IBM.
 At the same time, smaller firms in other sectors appear unable to attract
 this scarce talent.
 Two natural questions then arise: Is such allocation inefficient? And if
 so, can inventor misallocation explain the observed fall in R&D productivity?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer these questions, I study the broader effect of increasing market
 concentration on the allocation of inventors across sectors.
 I start by documenting several novel facts using US Patent and Trademark
 Office (USPTO) data and concentration measures from the Economic Census
 over the period 1997-2012.
 First and foremost, I show a positive correlation between increases in
 a sector's market concentration and the share of inventors it attracts.
 This correlation might indicate either that firms in high-concentration
 sectors have drawn more inventors or that they owe their success to large
 investment in research.
 To address this reverse causality problem, I adopt an instrumental variable
 strategy.
 I use the increase in the number of product-market regulations from Mercatus
 RegData as an instrument for increased concentration.
 This specification shows that sectors with increased concentration have
 increased their share of inventors and not vice versa.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two additional findings substantiate that high-concentration sectors are
 using R&D resources inefficiently and consequently depressing aggregate
 research productivity.
 First, the quality of patents in sectors with increased concentration declined,
 as measured by patent forward citations.
 Second, research productivity, as measured as growth in output per worker
 per inventor, has decreased in these sectors.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This measure of inventor productivity mirrors the analogous definition of
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

research productivity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 offered by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In the introduction to their paper, they decompose economic growth into
 the product of the number of researchers and a term capturing research
 productivity.
 Following this definition, I compute inventors' productivity as the ratio
 of the growth in each sector, which I measure using output per worker growth,
 and the number of inventors employed by that sector.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Further, I find that dominant firms draw a disproportionate share of their
 sector's inventors.
 Based on these three observations, I conclude that incumbent firms are
 focusing their research efforts on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

defensive innovation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that is, projects with the primary aim of warding off potential competition.
 I provide suggestive evidence for this mechanism for the period 2002-2012,
 where I document a strong correlation between increases in sectors' inventor
 shares and patent litigation cases.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I have to restrict the analysis to 2002-2012 since the USPTO Patent Number
 and Case Code File Dataset 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schwartzUSPTOPatentNumber2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 only provides data on patent litigation for the period 2003-2016.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Quantitatively, the midpoint of my estimates implies that inventor misallocatio
n is responsible for a 0.78pp fall in the average annual growth in output-per-wor
ker growth in the study sample.
 That translates to 27.3% of the observed decline over the period 1997-2012.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Methodologically, my analysis relies on a novel dataset of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowledge markets,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 defined as sets of product markets that share similar inventors.
 These markets are based on the network of inventor transitions across product
 categories, identified using USPTO patents classified by their NAICS sectors
 of application.
 This approach avoids pooling inventors with unrelated technical expertise,
 which would bias the response of inventor mobility to sectoral characteristics
 toward zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second part of the paper, I develop a model of R&D resource allocation.
 My objectives are twofold.
 First, I use the model to explain how inefficient defensive innovations
 can arise and proliferate as concentration increases.
 Second, I quantify the R&D productivity effects of increasing concentration
 and evaluate how R&D subsidies can be best allocated in the presence of
 defensive innovation.
 I adopt a Schumpeterian creative-destruction framework in which new entrants
 conduct productive R&D while incumbents employ inventors in defensive projects.
 A two-sector general equilibrium model shows that unbalanced changes in
 concentration across sectors generate a fall in inventor productivity and
 growth.
 Indeed, inventors shift to less competitive markets, where defensive projects,
 which hamper entry and Schumpeterian growth, are more prevalent, and away
 from competitive sectors where their efforts would be more productive.
 The theoretical analysis shows that defensive innovation is the key factor
 behind increased concentration of inventors among incumbents and the fall
 in R&D productivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I calibrate a two-sector version of my model to match moments of the R&D
 spending distribution in 1997 and growth over the period 1997-2012.
 This calibration produces a 2.5% fall in output per worker growth from misalloca
tion, close to the 3% lower bound implied by my estimates.
 In the context of this model, I study the allocation of cost-neutral R&D
 subsidies that maximize growth.
 The model suggests that subsidizing entrants' R&D in more concentrated
 sectors constitutes the most effective policy, leading to a rise in annual
 GDP growth of about 0.5pp (a 17% increase from the 2012 benchmark).
 Similar results obtain if entry is uniformly subsidized across sectors.
 This finding resonates with the fact that defensive innovation is the main
 inefficiency in the model.
 Since this friction acts through an increase in entry barriers, the best
 way to counter it is to lower entry costs.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.

\begin_layout Standard
My work builds on the empirical and theoretical literature analyzing the
 impact of product market competition on innovation.
 First, I analyze how increased concentration affects the allocation of
 R&D 
\emph on
across sectors
\emph default
 in a departure from previous work that took either a within-sector or economy-w
ide approach.
 Second, I explicitly analyze the allocation of R&D inputs across sectors
 by identifying the boundaries of markets for inventors rather than relying
 on R&D spending or similar measures of innovative effort as in previous
 work.
 Third, I correlate changes in the competitive environment to documented
 trends on falling R&D productivity.
 Fourth, I model the impact on R&D productivity of pre-emptive innovation
 in a multi-sector model, and I arrive at a growth-maximizing policy in
 this context.
 Both the focus on R&D productivity and the policy analysis are novel to
 the theoretical literature analyzing defensive innovation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First an foremost, my paper relates to the vast literature estimating the
 empirical effect of competition on innovation.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "aghionCompetitionInnovationInvertedU2005a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 found that innovation increased at low levels of competition and decreased
 at high levels, depicting the relationship as an inverted U.
 Accordingly, papers in this literature have highlighted contrasting effects
 of competition on overall R&D activity, focusing mostly on episodes of
 trade liberalization 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

key "shuImpactTradeLiberalization2019"

\end_inset

.
 Most papers in this strand identify these effects at the firm-level, which
 restricts their scope to the effect of competition within product markets.
 My paper instead adopts a cross-sector view, analyzing the extent to which
 decreased competition in one market draws away resources from other markets.
 To do so, I build a novel dataset of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowledge markets,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sets of product markets that share the same inventors.
 While several papers investigate the mobility of inventors

 on inventors' movements across sectors.

 My contribution bridges these literatures, explicitly linking changes in
 the competitive structure to the allocation of R&D resources across more
 and less concentrated sectors, and their deployment to productive or defensive
 projects.
 The results I present are consistent with the findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 while increasing productivity and firm entry.

 Most recently,

 show that, within product markets, large firms tend to account for the
 bulk of patenting activity, but are responsible for a smaller share of
 implemented innovations relative to non-patenting firms.
 The authors interpret this finding as evidence of defensive innovation,
 intended to deter competition.
 My paper builds on this literature showing that increased concentration
 raises the incentives for defensive innovation, as demonstrated by a fall
 in forward citations in concentrating sectors.
 This result connects to the findings and the model of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 citations theoretically, showing that high-value patents also tend to receive
 fewer citations, and rationalize this result through pre-emptive innovation.

On a theoretical standpoint, I embed defensive patenting as modeled in in

 My solution relies on several results derived by

 To the best of my knowledge, my paper is the first to analyze the impact

 technological distance of incumbents from entrants, in the tradition of

 I extend their model to consider the effects of defensive innovation on
 R&D productivity and overall innovation.
 My final contribution consists in analyzing the growth-maximizing allocation
 of R&D subsidies, which has not been previously studied in this context.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, I propose and document a novel explanation for the observed
 decline in growth and R&D productivity over the last few decades.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My empirical results show that increasing misallocation of inventors across
 different product markets can account for up to 27% of the observed decline
 in output per worker growth in the sectors I analyze.
 This misallocation stems from uneven increases in concentration across
 product markets that are accompanied by a larger share of inventors accruing
 to less competitive sectors.
 I interpret my findings as resulting from an increase in defensive innovation
 in concentrated sectors.
 Such R&D activities are conducted with the primary aim of blocking further
 entry and are reflected in a decline in patents’ forward citations and
 an increased share of inventors employed by the largest incumbents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theoretical analysis examines the effects of defensive innovation in
 a Schumpeterian model of creative destruction, where incumbents can conduct
 defensive innovation to raise new entrants’ costs.
 In the model, pre-emptive innovation is the driving force behind misallocation
 across sectors.
 Having established the importance of this mechanism, I employ a calibrated
 two-sector version of the model to study the growth-maximizing allocation
 of R&D subsidies across sectors, as well as between incumbents and entrants.
 My analysis suggests that R&D subsidies provided to entrants constitute
 the most effective policy, directly tackling the friction generated by
 defensive innovation and potentially increasing growth by 17% of my baseline
 (0.5pp in absolute terms).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two main directions for future research stand out.
 The first would be to investigate the validity of my findings in an internation
al context, given that results in the literature of competition and innovation
 depend strongly on the country and the period analyzed.
 The second would be to conduct a thorough investigation of the evolution,
 causes, and consequences of pre-emptive innovation.
