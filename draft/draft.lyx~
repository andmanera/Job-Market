\begin_layout Abstract
\paragraph_spacing single
Inventors are a scarce resource, whose skill sets can apply to R&D in disparate
 product markets.
 Motivated by this fact and by the fall in R&D productivity that characterized
 recent decades, I explore the impact of product market competition on the
 misallocation of inventors and growth.
 First, I delineate the boundaries of “knowledge markets”, employing USPTO
 patent data to group NAICS sectors that employ inventors with similar skills.
 Second, I analyze the relation between 4-digit NAICS sectors’ market concentrat
ion and their share of knowledge-market inventors.
 I establish that: (i) the last thirty years saw a sizable increase in the
 concentration of inventors across NAICS sectors of application; (ii) over
 the period 1997-2012, sectors with increasing concentration have captured
 rising shares of inventors; (iii) high-concentration sectors saw an increase
 in inventors at the top of the innovating firms distribution, a fall in
 forward citations, and a decrease in R&D productivity, as measured by growth
 in output per worker per inventor.
 Quantitatively, my estimates imply that inventor misallocation to less
 competitive sectors produced a 27% reduction in output per worker growth
 over the period 1997-2012 (-0.78pp in absolute value).
 I interpret my findings through a Schumpeterian model of creative destruction,
 where incumbents can conduct 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

defensive patenting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with the primary aim to erect barriers to entry for potential competitors.
 In the model, unbalanced increases in markups shift inventors towards less
 competitive sectors, and towards monopolistic firms carrying out defensive
 innovation, reducing R&D productivity and growth.
 A calibration of this model reveals that directing R&D subsidies to entrants
 in high-concentration sectors is the most effective policy to maximize
 productivity, raising annual GDP growth by 0.5pp (17% of the calibrated
 baseline).

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Research and Development activities are key to innovation and growth.
 Yet, as documented by a growing literature, R&D productivity and growth
 have been falling over the last few decades 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bloomAreIdeasGetting2020,fernaldFutureUSEconomic2014,gordonRiseFallAmerican2016"

\end_inset

.
 A prominent explanation of these trends is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ideas are getting harder to find
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 due to increased technological complexity.
 A less explored alternative sees instead growing inefficiency in the allocation
 of R&D inputs as the root cause of this phenomenon 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "acemogluInnovationReallocationGrowth2018a,acemogluBottlenecksSectoralImbalances2021"

\end_inset

, a concern that is echoed in policy circles as well as the press 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "metzTechGiantsAre2017,bassBigTechSwallows2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Central in the current policy debate is the concern that big-tech firms
 are attracting a large share of highly-educated, highly-skilled workers,
 potentially subtracting these resources from more dynamic and competitive
 sectors.
 A case in point is the high concentration of AI specialists.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "talentseer2020AITalent2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, up to 20% of total AI experts are employed by just five big-tech companies:
 Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and IBM.
 At the same time, smaller firms in different sectors appear unable to attract
 this scarce talent.
 Two natural questions then arise: Is such allocation inefficient? And if
 so, can inventor misallocation explain the observed fall in R&D productivity?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer these questions, I study the broader effect of increasing market
 concentration on the allocation of inventors across sectors.
 I start by documenting several novel facts using USPTO patent data and
 concentration measures from the Economic Census over the period 1997-2012.
 First and foremost, I show that there is a positive correlation between
 increases in sectors' market concentration and the share of inventors they
 attract.
 This correlation might indicate either that high-concentration firms have
 attracted more inventors, or that more inventive firms have captured an
 increasing share of their product market thanks to successful innovations.
 In order to address this reverse causality problem, I adopt an IV strategy
 employing the increase in the number of product-market regulations from
 Mercatus RegData as an instrument for increased concentration.
 This specification shows that sectors with increased concentration have
 increased their share of inventors, and not vice versa.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I then present three additional facts that bolster the interpretation that
 high-concentration sectors are absorbing excessive R&D resources, depressing
 aggregate research productivity.
 First, researchers accrued mostly to incumbent firms in concentrated sectors.
 Second, the quality of patents in sectors with increased concentration
 has fallen, as measured by patent forward citations.
 Third, inventors' productivity, that I measure as growth in output per
 worker per inventor, has decreased in these sectors.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This measure of inventor productivity mirrors the analogous definition of
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

research productivity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 offered by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

.
 In the introduction to their paper, and following a large growth literature,
 they decompose economic growth into the product of the number of researchers
 and a term capturing research productivity.
 Following this definition, I compute inventors' productivity as the ratio
 of the growth in each sector, which I measure using output per worker growth,
 and the number of inventors employed by that sector.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 These findings suggest that additional inventors have accrued to incumbents
 who employed them on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

defensive innovation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, that is, projects with a low growth footprint conducted with the primary
 aim of preventing further entry and sheltering existing dominant positions.
 Quantitatively, the midpoint of my estimates implies that inventor misallocatio
n is responsible for a 0.78pp fall in output-per-worker growth in the sectors
 I study (27.3% of the overall observed reduction over the period 1997-2012).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Methodologically, my analysis relies on a novel dataset of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowledge markets,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 defined as sets of product markets that share similar inventors.
 These markets originate from the network of transitions of individual inventors
 across product categories, identified using USPTO patents classified by
 their NAICS sectors of application.
 This classification is crucial to avoid pooling inventors and sectors that
 do not share the same technical expertise.
 If this were the case, the response of inventor mobility to changes in
 sectoral characteristics would be biased toward zero, as many sectors identifie
d as potential outlets for each inventor would in facts not be such.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second part of the paper, I develop a model of R&D resource allocation.
 My objectives are twofold.
 First, I use the model to explain how inefficient defensive innovations
 can arise and become intensified as concentration increases.
 Second, I quantify the R&D productivity effects of increasing concentration,
 and evaluate how R&D subsidies can be best allocated in the presence of
 defensive innovation.
 I adopt a Schumpeterian creative-destruction framework where, in addition
 to productive R&D conducted by new entrants, incumbents can engage in defensive
 projects to increase entry cost faced by potential competitors.
 A two-sector general equilibrium model shows that unbalanced changes in
 concentration across sectors generate a fall in inventor productivity and
 growth.
 Indeed, inventors are misallocated to less competitive markets where defensive
 projects—which hamper entry and Schumpeterian growth—are more prevalent,
 and away from competitive sectors where growth is more sustained.
 The theoretical analysis shows that defensive innovation is a crucial mechanism
 to generate the increased concentration of inventors among incumbents that
 I find in the data, as well as the fall in R&D productivity, which are
 both absent in a framework abstracting from these features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I calibrate a two-sector version of my model to match moments of the R&D
 spending distribution in 1997 and growth over the period 1997-2012.
 This calibration produces a 2.5% fall in output per worker growth from misalloca
tion, close to the 3% lower bound implied by my estimates.
 In the context of this model, I study the allocation of cost-neutral R&D
 subsidies that maximizes growth.
 The model suggests that subsidizing entrants' R&D in more concentrated
 sectors constitutes the most effective policy, leading to a rise in annual
 GDP growth of about 0.5pp (a 17% increase from the 2012 benchmark).
 Similar results obtain if entry is uniformly subsidized across the two
 sectors.
 This finding resonates with the fact that defensive innovation constitutes
 the main friction hampering efficiency in the model.
 Since this friction acts through an increase in entry barriers, the most
 effective way to counter it consists in alleviating entry costs.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows.
 In the following section, I survey the related literature place my study

\begin_layout Subsection
Related Literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My work connects to several strand in the empirical and theoretical literature
 analyzing the effect of product market competition on innovation.
 As detailed below, I contribute to this literature through four substantial
 deviations.
 First, I analyze the effect of competition on the allocation of R&D 
\emph on
across sectors,
\emph default
 while previous work has focused on either a within-sector or economy-wide
 perspective.
 Second, I explicitly analyze the allocation of R&D inputs across sectors,
 and I do so identifying the boundaries of markets for inventors rather
 than relying on R&D spending or similar measures of innovative effort as
 in previous work.
 Third, I connect changes in the competitive structure to the documented
 trends on falling R&D productivity.
 Fourth, I study theoretically the impact of pre-emptive innovation in a
 multi-sector model on R&D productivity, and the growth-maximizing policy
 in this context.
 Both the focus on R&D productivity and the policy analysis are novel to
 the theoretical literature analyzing defensive innovation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First an foremost, my paper relates to the vast literature estimating the
 empirical effect of competition on innovation.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "aghionCompetitionInnovationInvertedU2005a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 famously documented an inverted-U relationship between competition and
 innovation, whereby this relation is increasing at low levels of competition,
 and decreases at high levels.
 Accordingly, papers in this literature have highlighted contrasting effects
 of competition on overall R&D activity, focusing mostly on episodes of
 trade liberalization 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after " for an extensive review"
before "see"
key "shuImpactTradeLiberalization2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Most papers in this trend identify these effects at the firm-level, which
 restricts their scope to the effect of competition within product markets.
 My paper instead adopts a cross-sector view, analyzing the effect of increased
 concentration in some sectors on the 
\emph on
share of available

\emph on

 they appropriate.
 In order to do so, I build a novel dataset of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

knowledge markets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, sets of product markets that share the same inventors.
 While several papers investigate the mobility of inventors

, my paper is to the best of my knowledge the first to analyze the effects
 of market structure on inventors' transitions across sectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to my focus on competition and innovation, my paper naturally connects
 to the literatures that document increased concentration

 My contribution bridges these literatures, explicitly linking changes in
 the competitive structure to the allocation of R&D resources across more
 and less concentrated sectors, as well as their deployment to productive
 or defensive projects.

 Most recently, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 show that, within product markets, large firms tend to account for the
 bulk of patenting activity, but are responsible for a smaller share of
 implemented innovations relative to non-patenting firms.
 The authors interpret this finding as evidence of defensive innovation,
 which provides high value to patents of entrenched firms who can thus shelter
 their dominant position from competitors.
 My paper builds on this literature showing that increased concentration
 raises the incentives for defensive innovation, as demonstrated by a fall
 in forward citations in concentrating sectors.
 This result connects to the findings and the model

 citations theoretically, showing that high-value patents also tend to receive
 less citations, and rationalize this result through pre-emptive innovation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a theoretical standpoint, I embed defensive patenting as modeled in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 into a Schumpeterian growth model, building on the extensive literature
 inaugurated by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In particular, my solution relies on several results derived by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "acemogluIntellectualPropertyRights2012"

 To the best of my knowledge, my paper is the first to analyze the impact
 of defensive innovation in the context of general-equilibrium growth model.
 The closest precedent to this analysis is

, and defines their incremental innovation, that is innovation conducted
 on existing product lines available to incumbents, as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

.
 Therefore, in his framework, defensive innovation corresponds to incremental
 innovation aimed at

 By contrast, in my framework defensive innovation is specifically aimed
 at protecting dominant positions and reduce entry as in

, who however do not consider the effects of defensive innovation on R&D
 productivity and overall innovation.
 My final contribution consists in analyzing the growth-maximizing allocation
 of R&D subsidies, which has not been previously studied in a framework
 featuring defensive innovation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, I have proposed and documented a novel explanation for the
 observed decline in growth and R&D productivity over the last few decades.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My empirical results showed that increasing misallocation of inventors across
 different product markets can account for up to 
\begin_inset Formula $27\%$
\end_inset

 of the observed decline in output per worker growth in the sectors I analyze.
 This misallocation resulted from uneven increases in concentration across
 product markets, which were accompanied by an increase in the share of
 inventors accruing to less competitive sectors.
 I interpret my findings as resulting from an increase in defensive innovation
 in concentrated sectors, defined as R&D activities conducted with the primary
 aim of blocking further entry, which manifest in the data as a fall in
 patents' forward citations and an increased share of inventors employed
 by the largest incumbents in these sectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theoretical analysis examined the effects of defensive innovation in
 a Schumpeterian model of creative destruction, where incumbents can conduct
 defensive innovation to raise new entrants' costs.
 In the model, pre-emptive innovation is crucial to generate misallocation
 across sectors, which would not occur in the absence of this mechanism.
 Having established the importance of this channel, I employed a calibrated
 two-sector version of the model to study the growth-maximizing allocation
 of R&D subsidies across sectors, as well as between incumbents and entrants.
 My analysis suggests that R&D subsidies provided to entrants constitute
 the most effective policy, directly tackling the friction generated by
 defensive innovation, and can increase growth by up to 17% of my baseline
 (0.5pp in absolute terms).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two main directions for future research stand out.
 First, it would be important to investigate the validity of my findings
 to an international context.
 Indeed, many findings in the literature of competition and innovation depend
 strongly on the country and the period analyzed.
 Second, my paper highlights the role of pre-emptive innovation as a major
 driver of the fall in R&D productivity.
