\begin_layout Abstract
\paragraph_spacing single
Inventors are a scarce resource, whose skill sets can apply to R&D in disparate
 product markets.
 Motivated by this observation, I explore the impact of product market competiti
on on the misallocation of inventors, and its implications for growth.
 First, I delineate the boundaries of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowledge markets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, employing USPTO patents data to group NAICS sectors that employ the same
 inventors.
 Second, I analyze the relation between 4-digit NAICS sectors market concentrati
on and the share of inventors employed in R&D projects relevant to these
 sectors.
 Four findings emerge from the analysis.
 First, the last thirty years saw a sizable increase in concentration of
 inventors across both patent (CPC) classes and their 4-digit sector of
 application.
 Second, over the period 1997-2012, increases in sector-level concentration
 are positively correlated with the share of inventor markets captured by
 each sector.
 An IV analysis based on the increase in sector-specific regulations suggests
 a causal interpretation of this result.
 Third, higher shares of relevant inventors are positively correlated with
 rising concentration of inventors at the top of the innovating firms distributi
on, and negatively with forward citations.
 Fourth, sectors with increased inventor concentration have seen a decrease
 in the productivity of inventors, as measured by the growth in output per
 worker.
 A back-of-the-envelope computation suggest that the increased concentration
 of inventors in less competitive sectors can account for about 29% of the
 overall decrease in output per worker growth over the period 1997-2012,
 which corresponds to a fall of 0.78% in absolute value.
 To rationalize my findings, I propose a Schumpeterian model of creative
 destruction, where incumbents can conduct defensive patenting, to rationalize
 my findings.
 In the model, higher markups increase R&D effort, as well as causing its
 allocation to defensive projects by incumbents.
 When different product markets compete for the same inventors, a largest
 share of researchers end up employed in defensive projects in less competitive
 sectors, lowering growth and R&D productivity.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Research and Development activities are key to innovation and growth.
 Yet, as documented by a growing literature, R&D productivity and growth
 have been falling over the last few decades 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bloomAreIdeasGetting2020,fernaldFutureUSEconomic2014,gordonRiseFallAmerican2016"

\end_inset

.
 A prominent explanation of these trends is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ideas are getting harder to find
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 due to increased technological complexity.
 A less explored alternative sees instead growing inefficiency in the allocation
 of R&D inputs as the root cause of this phenomenon 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "acemogluInnovationReallocationGrowth2018a,acemogluBottlenecksSectoralImbalances2021"

\end_inset

, a concern that is echoed in the policy circles as well as the press 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "metzTechGiantsAre2017,bassBigTechSwallows2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Central in the current policy debate is the concern that dominant big-tech
 firms are inefficiently appropriating a large share of highly-educated,
 highly-skilled workers, subtracting this crucial resource from more competitive
 and dynamic sectors.
 A stark example of this phenomenon is the high concentration of AI expert
 workforce.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "talentseer2020AITalent2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 estimates that up to 20% of total AI experts are employed by just five
 companies: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and IBM.
 At the same time, smaller firms in other economic sectors appear unable
 to attract this talent, raising concerns over the potential misallocation
 of innovators equipped with the latest technological skills.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper studies the broader effect of increasing concentration on the
 allocation of inventors across sectors, and shows that such concerns are
 justified.
 Using USPTO patent data and concentration measures from the Economic Census
 over the period 1997-2012, I demonstrate that sectors where concentration
 has increased have indeed attracted an increasing share of inventors.
 This relation has a causal interpretation, according to an IV specification
 where I use the increase in the number of regulations from Mercatus RegData
 as an instrument for increased concentration.
 I establish three additional facts that suggest that inventors are misallocated.
 First, researchers accrued mostly to incumbent firms in concentrated sectors.
 Second, the quality of patents in concentrating sectors has fallen, as
 measured by patent forward citations.
 Third, inventors' productivity, that I measure as growth in output per
 worker per inventor, has fallen in these sectors.
 Taken together, these findings suggest that additional inventors have accrued
 to incumbents who employed them on projects intended to pre-empt further
 entry, with a low growth footprint.
 I refer to this type of R&D as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

defensive innovation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Quantitatively, my findings imply that inventor misallocation implies a
 fall of up to .78pp in output-per-worker growth in the sectors I study (28.6%
 of the overall observed reduction over the period 1997-2012).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Methodologically, my analysis relies on a novel dataset of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowledge markets,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 defined as collections of product markets that share similar inventors.
 These inventor markets originate from the network generated by transitions
 of individual inventors across product categories, identified using USPTO
 patent data, where patents are classified according to their main NAICS
 sector of applications.
 This classification is crucial to avoid pooling inventors and sectors that
 do not share the same technical expertise.
 If this were the case, the response of inventor mobility to changes in
 sectoral characteristics would be biased toward zero, as many sectors identifie
d as potential outlets for each inventor would in facts not be such.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to interpret these results, I build a Schumpeterian model where,
 in addition to productive R&D conducted by new entrants, incumbents can
 engage in defensive projects to pre-empt entry and strengthen their dominant
 position.
 A two-sector general equilibrium model shows that unbalanced changes in
 concentration across sectors generate a fall in inventor productivity and
 growth.
 Indeed, inventors are misallocated towards less competitive markets where
 defensive projects—which hamper entry and Schumpeterian growth—are more
 prevalent, and away from more competitive sectors where growth is more
 sustained.
 The theoretical analysis shows that pre-emptive innovation is a crucial
 mechanism to generate the increased concentration of inventors among incumbents
 that I find in the data, as well as the fall in R&D productivity, which
 are both absent in a framework abstracting from these features.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I calibrate my two-sector to match moments of the R&D spending distribution
 in 1997, which produces productivity effects that are close to the lower
 bound implied by my estimates.
 I use this calibrated model to study the allocation of cost-neutral R&D
 subsidies that maximizes growth in this context.
 I find that subsidizing entrants' R&D in the more concentrated sector constitut
es the most effective policy, and leads to a rise in annual GDP growth of
 about 0.5pp (17% in relative terms).
 Similar results obtain if entry is uniformly subsidized across the two
 sectors.
 This finding resonates with the fact that defensive innovation constitutes
 the main friction hampering efficiency in the model.
 Since this friction acts through an increase in entry barriers, the most
 effective way to counter it consists in alleviating entry costs.

Related Literature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My work connects to several strand in the empirical and theoretical literature
 analyzing the effect of product market competition on innovation.
 As detailed below, I contribute to this literature through four substantial
 deviations.
 First, I analyze the effect of competition on the allocation of R&D 
\emph on
across sectors,
\emph default
 while previous work has focused on either a within-sector or economy-wide
 perspective.
 Second, I explicitly analyze the allocation of R&D inputs across sectors,
 and I do so identifying the boundaries of markets for inventors rather
 than relying on R&D spending or similar measures of innovative effort as
 in previous work.
 Third, I connect changes in the competitive structure to the documented
 trends on falling R&D productivity.
 Fourth, I study theoretically the impact of pre-emptive innovation in a
 multi-sector model on R&D productivity, and the growth-maximizing policy
 in this context.
 Both the focus on R&D productivity and the policy analysis are novel to
 the theoretical literature analyzing defensive innovation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First an foremost, my paper relates to the vast literature estimating the
 empirical effect of competition on innovation.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "aghionCompetitionInnovationInvertedU2005a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 famously documented an inverted-U relationship between competition and
 innovation, whereby this relation is increasing at low levels of competition,
 and decreases at high levels.
 Accordingly, papers in this literature have highlighted contrasting effects
 of competition on overall R&D activity, focusing mostly on episodes of
 trade liberalization 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

before "see"
key "shuImpactTradeLiberalization2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Most papers in this trend identify these effects at the firm-level, which
 restricts their scope to the effect of competition within product markets.
 My paper instead adopts a cross-sector view, analyzing the effect of increased
 concentration in some sectors on the 
\emph on

 they appropriate.
 In order to do so, I build a novel dataset of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, sets of product markets that share the same inventors.
 While several papers investigate the mobility of inventors

, my paper is to the best of my knowledge the first to analyze the effects
 of market structure on inventors' transitions across sectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to my focus on competition and innovation, my paper naturally connects
 to the literatures that document increased concentration 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 My contribution bridges these literatures, explicitly linking changes in
 the competitive structure to the allocation of R&D resources across more
 and less concentrated sectors, as well as their deployment to productive
 or defensive projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several papers document the role of pre-emptive innovation in ordinary firm
 operations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Most recently, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 show that, within product markets, large firms tend to account for the
 bulk of patenting activity, but are responsible for a smaller share of
 implemented innovations relative to non-patenting firms.
 The authors interpret this finding as evidence of defensive innovation,
 which provides high value to patents of entrenched firms who can thus shelter
 their dominant position from competitors.
 My paper builds on this literature showing that increased concentration
 raises the incentives for defensive innovation, as demonstrated by a fall
 in forward citations in concentrating sectors.
 This result connects to the findings and the model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, who study the cross-sectional relation between patent value and forward
 citations theoretically, showing that high-value patents also tend to receive
 less citations, and rationalize this result through pre-emptive innovation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On a theoretical standpoint, I embed defensive patenting as modeled in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 into a Schumpeterian growth model, building on the extensive literature
 inaugurated by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "aghionModelGrowthCreative1992"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In particular, my solution relies on several results derived by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "acemogluIntellectualPropertyRights2012"

\end_inset

.
 To the best of my knowledge, my paper is the first to analyze the impact
 of defensive innovation in the context of general-equilibrium growth model.
 The closest precedent to this analysis is

, and defines their incremental innovation, that is innovation conducted
 on existing product lines available to incumbents, as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

defensive
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 Therefore, in his framework, defensive innovation corresponds to incremental
 innovation aimed at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

escaping competition

 from entrants by increasing the technological distance of incumbents from
 entrants, in the tradition of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 By contrast, in my framework defensive innovation is specifically aimed
 at protecting dominant positions and reduce entry as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, who however do not consider the effects of defensive innovation on R&D
 productivity and overall innovation.
 My final contribution consists in analyzing the growth-maximizing allocation
 of R&D subsidies, which has not been previously studied in a framework
 featuring defensive innovation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, I have proposed and documented a novel explanation for the
 observed decline in growth and R&D productivity over the last few decades.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My empirical results showed that increasing misallocation of inventors across
 different product markets can account for up to 
\begin_inset Formula $27\%$
\end_inset

 of the observed decline in output per worker growth in the sectors I analyze.
 This misallocation resulted from uneven increases in concentration across
 product markets, which were accompanied by an increase in the share of
 inventors accruing to less competitive sectors.
 I interpret my findings as resulting from an increase in defensive innovation
 in concentrated sectors, defined as R&D activities conducted with the primary
 aim of blocking further entry, which manifest in the data as a fall in
 patents' forward citations and an increased share of inventors employed
 by the largest incumbents in these sectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theoretical analysis examined the effects of defensive innovation in
 a Schumpeterian model of creative destruction, where incumbents can conduct
 defensive innovation to raise new entrants' costs.
 In the model, pre-emptive innovation is crucial to generate misallocation
 across sectors, which would not occur in the absence of this mechanism.
 Having established the importance of this channel, I employed a calibrated
 two-sector version of the model to study the growth-maximizing allocation
 of R&D subsidies across sectors, as well as between incumbents and entrants.
 My analysis suggests that R&D subsidies provided to entrants constitute
 the most effective policy, directly tackling the friction generated by
 defensive innovation, and can increase growth by up to 17% of my baseline
 (0.5pp in absolute terms).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two main directions for future research stand out.
 First, it would be important to investigate the validity of my findings
 to an international context.
 Indeed, many findings in the literature of competition and innovation depend
 strongly on the country and the period analyzed.
 Second, my paper highlights the role of pre-emptive innovation as a major
 driver of the fall in R&D productivity.
 However, this topic is still relatively under-explored, and a thorough
 investigation of the evolution, causes and consequences of this phenomenon
 seems highly relevant in view of my results.
