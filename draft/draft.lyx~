\begin_layout Abstract
\paragraph_spacing single
Inventors are a scarce resource, whose skill sets can apply to R&D in disparate
 product markets.
 Motivated by this observation, I explore the impact of product market competiti
on on the misallocation of inventors, and its implications for growth.
 First, I delineate the boundaries of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowledge markets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, employing USPTO patents data to group NAICS sectors that employ the same
 inventors.
 Second, I analyze the relation between 4-digit NAICS sectors market concentrati
on and the share of inventors employed in R&D projects relevant to these
 sectors.
 Four findings emerge from the analysis.
 First, the last thirty years saw a sizable increase in concentration of
 inventors across both patent (CPC) classes and their 4-digit sector of
 application.
 Second, over the period 1997-2012, increases in sector-level concentration
 are positively correlated with the share of inventor markets captured by
 each sector.
 An IV analysis based on the increase in sector-specific regulations suggests
 a causal interpretation of this result.
 Third, sectors with increased inventor concentration have seen a decrease
 in the productivity of inventors, as measured by the growth in output per
 worker.
 Fourth, higher shares of relevant inventors are positively correlated with
 self-citations and with rising concentration of inventors at the top of
 the innovating firms distribution, and negatively with forward citations.
 A back-of-the-envelope computation suggest that the increased concentration
 of inventors in less competitive sectors can for up to 22.5% of the overall
 decrease in output per worker growth over the period 1997-2012, which correspon
ds to a fall of .45% in absolute value.
 To rationalize my findings, I propose a Schumpeterian model of creative
 destruction, where incumbents can conduct defensive patenting, to rationalize
 my findings.
 In the model, higher markups increase R&D effort, as well as causing its
 allocation to defensive projects by incumbents.
 When different product markets compete for the same inventors, a largest
 share of researchers end up employed in defensive projects in less competitive
 sectors, lowering growth and R&D productivity.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a long-standing debate in the press and policy circles over the
 allocation of talent in the economy, and whether skilled work is employed
 where it is most beneficial to economic growth and society overall.
 Central in the current policy debate is the concern that dominant big-tech
 firms are inefficiently appropriating a large share of highly-educated,
 highly-skilled workers, subtracting this crucial resource from more competitive
 and dynamic sectors.
 A stark example of this phenomenon is the high concentration of AI expert
 workforce.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "talentseer2020AITalent2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 estimates that up to 20% of total AI experts are employed by just five
 companies: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and IBM.
 At the same time, smaller firms in other economic sectors appear unable
 to attract this talent, raising concerns over the potential misallocation
 of innovators equipped with the latest technological skills.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper studies the broader effect of increasing concentration on the
 allocation of inventors across sectors, and shows that such concerns are
 justified.
 Using USPTO patent data and concentration measures from the Economic Census
 over the period 1997-2017, I demonstrate that sectors where concentration
 has increased have indeed attracted an increasing share of inventors.
 This relation has a causal interpretation, according to an IV specification
 where I use the increase in the number of regulations from Mercatus RegData
 as an instrument for increased concentration.
 I establish three additional facts that suggest that inventors are misallocated.
 First, researchers accrued mostly to incumbent firms in concentrated sectors.
 Second, the productivity of R&D in these sectors has fallen.
 Third, the patents deposited in these sectors have seen more self-citations
 and less forward citations, suggesting that additional inventors have been
 allocated to incremental project that did not pave the way for further
 developments.
 Quantitatively, my findings imply that inventor misallocation led to a
 fall of up to .45pp in output-per-worker growth in the sectors I study (20%
 of the overall observed reduction).

\begin_layout Plain Layout
XXXXXXXXXThis project originates from four simple observations.
 First, inventors with specific competencies are a scarce—and fundamental—resour
ce for R&D.
 Second, due to this scarcity, firms compete for inventors.
 Third, inventors’ technological competencies allow them to produce applications
 that span multiple economic sectors.
 As a result, firms competing for a same set of inventors can belong to
 radically different product markets.
 Fourth, market concentration increases the value of R&D, especially of
 a defensive type.
 Thus, inventors mostly accrue to less competitive sectors, and, within
 these sectors, to incumbent firms conducting defensive R&D to shelter their
 dominant position.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on these four observations, the main hypothesis of this paper is that
 differences in concentration across product markets that employ the same
 types of inventors generate a inefficiency, which pushes economic growth
 below its potential.
 Indeed, inventors are misallocated towards less competitive markets where
 defensive projects—which hamper entry and Schumpeterian growth—are more
 prevalent, and away from more competitive sectors where growth is more
 sustained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I offer three main contributions.
 First, I construct a dataset of “inventor markets”, defined as collections
 of product markets that share similar inventors.
 These inventor markets originate from the network generated by transitions
 of individual inventors across product categories, identified using USPTO
 patent data, where patents are classified according to their main NAICS
 sector of applications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, I provide empirical evidence in favor of the misallocation channel
 described above, using USPTO patent data, Economic Census concentration
 measures, and Mercatus regulation data over the 1997-2017 horizon.
 I show that, within inventor markets, sectors where competition has fallen
 increased their share of researchers.
 In addition, inventors have accrued to incumbent firms in less competitive
 sectors, where show that growth in output per worker has fallen, self-citations
 have increased, and forward citations decreased.
 These results suggests that researchers have been increasingly allocated
 to defensive projects.
 Quantitatively, my findings imply that increased market concentration over
 the last 20 years can explain up to 20% of the overall fall in inventor
 productivity, which many studies identified as a culprit for stagnant overall
 productivity growth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, in order to interpret these results, I build a Schumpeterian model
 where, in addition to productive R&D conducted by new entrants, incumbents
 can engage in defensive projects to reduce entry and strengthen their dominant
 position.
 A two-sector general equilibrium model shows that unbalanced changes in
 concentration across sectors generate a fall in inventor productivity and
 growth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CONJECTURE: Under the lenses of my model, a planner wishing to maximize
 long-run growth and taking the market structure as given, should provide
 a sector-specific R&D subsidy to entrants in order to reduce the impact
 of defensive patent walls and to conform the sectoral R&D allocation to
 maximize aggregate GDP growth.

\begin_layout Standard
This section presents a Schumpeterian model featuring growth through creative
 destruction by entrants, as well as the possibility for incumbent monopolist
 of researching a defensive technology that increases research costs for
 entrants.
 In what follows, I first present a single-sector model to clarify the mechanism
 at play within each sector in the economy, and show that increases in the
 markup, capturing concentration in reduced form, lead to a larger amount
 of resources devoted to defensive innovation.
 Then, I move to consider a two-sector model, where each sector is identical
 to the single-sector model.
 I show that increasing markups in one of the two sectors of the economy
 lead to a misallocation of R&D resources towards defensive innovation in
 the less competitive sector.
 In order to illustrate the properties of the demand for inventors, I first
 analyze a single-sector partial-equilibrium version of the model, where
 labor supply of inventors and production is perfectly elastic at a fixed
 wage.
 I then consider a two-sector model where wages are determined in equilibrium,
 and the supply of inventors is assumed to be fixed in each instant.

In the empirical analysis above I used the HHI as a measure of concentration
 and market power.

 shows that the Lerner Index from NBER-CES, a standard measure of markups,
 is strongly correlated with the HHI in my sample, justifying the reduced-form
 mapping that adopt in what follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Environment: a Single-sector Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption good in the economy in each instant is a Cobb-Douglas aggregate
 of a measure-one continuum of products:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{t}=\int_{0}^{1}y_{t}(i)\mathrm{d}i
\]

\end_inset

The consumption good in the economy is taken as the numeraire.
 The market for each product 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}(i)$
\end_inset

 consists of a monopolist and a fringe of competitors.
 In what follows, I focus on a single market, dropping the argument 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Competitors can produce using a linear technology with labor requirement
 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{t}$
\end_inset

, while the incumbent has labor requirement 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{c_{t}}{\phi}$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi>1$
\end_inset

.
 In this section, the labor supply is assumed perfectly elastic at 
\begin_inset Formula $w=1$
\end_inset

.
 Given these assumption, the monopolist sets the limit price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}=c_{t}$
\end_inset

 realizing profits:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Pi_{t}=\left(c_{t}-\frac{c_{t}}{\phi}\right)y_{t}=\left(\frac{\phi-1}{\phi}\right)c_{t}y_{t},
\]

\end_inset

By the Cobb-Douglas assumption on the final good, the demand for each product
 is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{t}=\frac{Y_{t}}{p_{t}}=\frac{Y_{t}}{c_{t}}
\]

\end_inset

Giving the normalized profit:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\Pi_{t}}{Y_{t}}\equiv\pi_{i}=\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Innovation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that competitors can realize an innovation reducing unit costs to
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{c_{t}}{\left(1+\eta\right)\phi}$
\end_inset

 investing in inventors at unit cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

.
 When one of the competitors succeed in replacing the incumbent monopolist,
 the other competitors can immediately realize a cost reduction to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{c_{t}}{1+\eta}$
\end_inset

, so that the gap between monopolist and followers is fixed at 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 regardless of followers' innovations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Incumbents can in turn invest in a defensive technology that lowers the
 productivity of followers' inventors, by a factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega>1$
\end_inset

.
 I assume that this investment is completely unproductive, capturing a defensive
 patent that is unused by the incumbent.
 This defensive investment can be done only once, and is lost at rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 (the degree of patent protection).
 The incumbents' problem in normalized units as a function of the state
 capturing entrant costs is then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\rho v(1) & =\max_{x_{I}}\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)-\alpha_{I}\frac{x_{I}^{2}}{2}+x_{I}\left(v(\omega)-v(1)\right)-x_{e,1}\left(v(1)\right)\\
\rho v(\omega) & =\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)+\delta\left(v(1)-v(\omega)\right)-x_{e,\omega}\left(v(\omega)\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

\rho V^{I}(\omega) & =\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)+\delta\left(V(1)-V(\omega)\right)-x_{e,\omega}\left(V^{I}(\omega)\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The optimal RD effort by the incumbent solves:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha_{I}x_{I}^{\gamma-1}=\left(V(\omega)-V(1)\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{I}=\left(\frac{V(\omega)-V(1)}{\alpha_{I}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}
\]

\end_inset

The value function is then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\rho V^{I}(1) & =\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)-\alpha_{I}\frac{\left(\frac{V(\omega)-V(1)}{\alpha_{I}}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}}{\gamma}+\left(\frac{V(\omega)-V(1)}{\alpha_{I}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}\left(V(\omega)-V(1)\right)-x_{e,1}\left(V^{I}(1)\right)\\
 & =\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)-\frac{1}{\alpha_{I}^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}}\frac{\left(V(\omega)-V(1)\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}}{\gamma}+\frac{1}{\alpha_{I}^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}}\left(V(\omega)-V(1)\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}-x_{e,1}\left(V^{I}(1)\right)\\
 & =\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)+\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\frac{\left(V(\omega)-V(1)\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}}{\alpha_{I}^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}}-x_{e,1}\left(V^{I}(1)\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

When successful, entrants obtains the unprotected monopoly position, that
 is, they destroy any existing patent barrier and obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $v(1)$
\end_inset

.
 I assume that the research costs of each atomistic entrant are linear in
 the individual research effort, as well in the innovation intensity of
 other entrants, capturing crowding externalities:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C\left(x_{e,\omega,i}\right)=\zeta\omega x_{e,\omega,i}x_{e,\omega}.
\]

\end_inset

The maximization problem of an entrant in each state 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\max_{x_{e,\omega,i}}x_{e,\omega,i}v(1)-\zeta\omega x_{e,\omega,i}x_{e,\omega}.
\]

\end_inset

The total research effort by entrants in the sector is then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{e,\omega}=\frac{v(1)}{\omega\zeta},
\]

\end_inset

With quadratic costs, the optimal investment for the incumbent is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{I}=\bm{1}\left\{ v(\omega)-v(1)>0\right\} \frac{v(\omega)-v(1)}{\alpha_{I}}.
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Consider first the second equation.
 That gives:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left(\rho+\delta\right)v(\omega) & =\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)+\delta\left(v(1)\right)-\frac{v(1)}{\zeta\omega}\left(v(\omega)\right)\\
\left(\rho+\delta+\frac{v(1)}{\zeta\omega}\right)v(\omega) & =\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)+\delta\left(v(1)\right)\\
v(\omega) & =\left(\rho+\delta+\frac{v(1)}{\zeta\omega}\right)^{-1}\left[\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)+\delta\left(v(1)\right)\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho v(1)=\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)+\frac{\left(v(\omega)-v(1)\right)^{2}}{2\alpha_{I}}-\frac{\left(v(1)\right)^{2}}{\zeta}
\]

\end_inset

Assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0$
\end_inset

 (infinite patent protection),
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v(\omega)=\frac{\zeta\omega}{\rho\zeta\omega+v(1)}\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

Replacing:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho v(1)=\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)+\frac{\left(\frac{\zeta\omega}{\rho\zeta\omega+v(1)}\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)-v(1)\right)^{2}}{2\alpha_{I}}-\frac{\left(v(1)\right)^{2}}{\zeta},
\]

\end_inset

Note:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\zeta\omega}{\rho\zeta\omega+v(1)}\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)-v(1) & =\frac{\zeta\omega}{\rho\zeta\omega+v(1)}\left[\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)-\left(\frac{\rho\zeta\omega+v(1)}{\zeta\omega}\right)v(1)\right]\\
 & =\frac{\zeta\omega}{\rho\zeta\omega+v(1)}\left[\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)-\frac{\left(v(1)\right)^{2}}{\zeta\omega}-\rho v(1)\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Which can be solved numerically.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Now let us focus on incumbents' investment, which is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $v(\omega)-v(1)$
\end_inset

.
 Then, we obtain:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial\omega}\frac{\left(v(\omega)-v(1)\right)}{\alpha_{I}}=\frac{\frac{\zeta\omega}{\rho\zeta\omega+v(1)}\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)-v(1)}{\alpha_{I}}=\frac{\zeta\left(\rho\zeta\omega+v(1)\right)-\zeta^{2}\rho\omega}{\alpha_{I}\left[\rho\zeta\omega+v(1)\right]^{2}}>0
\]

\end_inset

The same sign holds for 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

, the entry cost, although in that case 
\begin_inset Formula $v(1)$
\end_inset

 increases as well.
 Investment increases in the markups, as expected.
 As for entrants, investment increases like 
\begin_inset Formula $v(1).$
\end_inset

 Note:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho v(\omega)=\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)+\delta\left(v(1)-v(\omega)\right)-\frac{v(1)}{\zeta\omega}\left(v(\omega)\right)
\]

\end_inset

therefore
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\rho\left(v(\omega)-v(1)\right) & =\delta\left(v(1)-v(\omega)\right)-\frac{v(1)}{\zeta\omega}\left(v(\omega)\right)-\frac{\left(v(\omega)-v(1)\right)^{2}}{2\alpha_{I}}+\frac{v(1)}{\zeta}v(1)\\
\left(\rho+\delta+\frac{\left(v(\omega)-v(1)\right)}{2\alpha_{I}}\right)\left(v(\omega)-v(1)\right) & =\frac{v(1)}{\zeta}\left(v(1)-\frac{v(\omega)}{\omega}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

This can be used to show that, if there is defensive investment, we have
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega v(1)>v(\omega)$
\end_inset

.
 Note: to have positive research we must have:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v(\omega)-v(1)>0
\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{I}=0$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\rho v(1) & =\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)-x_{e,1}\left(v(1)\right)\\
\rho v(\omega) & =\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)+\delta\left(v(1)-v(\omega)\right)-x_{e,\omega}\left(v(\omega)\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\rho v(\omega)-\rho v(1) & =x_{e,1}v(1)-x_{e,\omega}v(\omega)\\
 & =\frac{v(1)}{\zeta}v(1)-\frac{v(1)}{\zeta\omega}v(\omega)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus, again, 
\begin_inset Formula $v(\omega)-v(1)>0$
\end_inset

 IFF 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega v(1)-v(\omega)>0$
\end_inset

.
 Is this always true? Suppose not, then the firm's investment has to be
 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, the values to the firm are simply:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v(1)=\frac{m_{i}}{\rho+x_{e,1}},\ v(\omega)=\frac{m_{i}}{\rho+x_{e,\omega}},
\]

\end_inset

By the entrant's optimal solution we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{e,\omega}=\frac{x_{e,1}}{\omega}$
\end_inset

, and:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega v(1)=\frac{m_{i}}{\frac{\rho}{\omega}+x_{e,\omega}}>\frac{m_{i}}{\rho+x_{e,\omega}}=\nu(\omega),
\]

\end_inset

a contradiction.
 Given a optimal research effort 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, the firm's lifetime values are:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left(\rho+x^{\star}+x_{e,1}\right)v(1) & =\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)-\alpha_{I}\frac{x^{\star,2}}{2}+x^{\star}\left(v(\omega)\right)\\
\left(\rho+\delta+x_{e,\omega}\right)v(\omega) & =\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)+\delta\left(v(1)\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus we have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v(1)=\frac{\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)-\alpha_{I}\frac{x^{\star}}{2}+x^{\star}\left(v(\omega)\right)}{\left(\rho+x^{\star}+x_{e,1}\right)}
\]

\end_inset

In particular, in an equilibrium with positive research it holds:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
v(1) & >\frac{\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)}{\left(\rho+x_{e,1}\right)}\\
v(1) & >\frac{\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)}{\left(\rho+\frac{v(1)}{\zeta}\right)}\\
\rho v(1)+\zeta v(1)^{2} & >\zeta\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)

Stationary distribution

\begin_layout Standard
The law of motion of the distribution across states satisfies:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\dot{\mu}_{1} & =-\left(x_{I}+x_{e,1}\right)\mu_{1}+\delta\mu_{\omega}+x_{e,\omega}\mu_{e,\omega}+x_{e,1}\mu_{e,1},\label{eq: dist1}\\

\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{e,1},\mu_{e,\omega}$
\end_inset

 are the mass of entrants targeting products without a patent barrier, and
 with a patent barrier, respectively.
 Outflows from incumbent state 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 are given by the sum of successful incumbent defensive research, and eliminatio
n of incumbents by entrants.
 Inflows are given by expiration of patent protection moving incumbents
 in state 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 to state 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, and successful entry.
 The incumbent state 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 loses mass from successful entrants and patent depreciation, and gains
 mass from successful defensive RD.
 The last two equations close the system by acknowledging that entrants
 lose mass from successful entry, and gain mass from displaced incumbents.
 The stationary distribution satisfies: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mu_{\omega} & =\frac{x_{I}}{x_{I}+x_{e,\omega}+\delta},\\
\mu_{1} & =\frac{x_{e,\omega}+\delta}{x_{I}+x_{e,\omega}+\delta},\\
\mu_{e,\omega} & =\frac{\omega x_{I}\mu_{1}+\left(\omega x_{e,\omega}+x_{I}\right)\mu_{\omega}}{\omega\left(x_{e,\omega}+\delta\right)+x_{I}},\\
\mu_{e,1} & =\frac{\omega\left(x_{e,\omega}+\delta\right)\mu_{1}+\delta\mu_{\omega}}{\omega\left(x_{e,\omega}+\delta\right)+x_{I}}.

By the optimal solution for entrants:

Consider the ratio:
\begin_inset Formula

\frac{\alpha_{I}\frac{x_{I}^{2}}{2}\mu_{1}}{\zeta\omega x_{e,\omega}\left(\mu_{e,\omega}+\mu_{e,1}\right)+\alpha_{I}\frac{x_{I}^{2}}{2}\mu_{1}} & =\\

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, increase in growth is a byproduct of the perfectly elastic supply
 of inventors, who get drawn into R&D by increased profits.
 It is apparent that the increased in growth is driven by the increase in
 entrants' R&D activity, while the decrease in inventor productivity is
 driven by the increase in the inventors' share hired by monopolists engaged
 in defensive innovation.

Two sectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider the presence of two sectors.
 Keep the workers' wage as given, but now assume that inventors' wages,
 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 are determined in equilibrium.
 First assume that the final good is also a Cobb-Douglas with share 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$
\end_inset

 of two sectors as described above.
 Equilibrium in the inventor market is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X^{s}(w)=\sum_{i=\left\{ 1,2\right\} }\left(RD_{i}(w)\right),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{s}$
\end_inset

 is the inventors' supply schedule.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Complete solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Differently for before, each sector has a price index.
 By the above assumptions, the final good is produced according to:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y=\prod Y_{i}^{\beta_{i}}.\label{eq: FinalY}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

With the final good as numeraire, the sector's demand schedule is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{i}=\beta_{i}\frac{Y}{P_{i}}.\label{eq: SectorY}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

From CD on intermediate goods we also have:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{i}Y_{i}=p_{is}y_{is},\quad\forall s.
\]

\end_inset

In each sector, the price is set at the competitive fringe's marginal cost
 
\begin_inset Formula $wc_{i},$
\end_inset

 and is identical across subsectors .
 Thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{i}=p_{is}=wc_{i},\ Y_{i}=\beta_{i}\frac{Y}{wc_{i}}\label{eq: EqPY}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Equilibrium profits are given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Pi_{i}=\left(c_{i}w-\frac{c_{i}w}{\phi_{i}}\right)Y_{i}=\left(\frac{\phi_{i}-1}{\phi_{i}}\right)\beta_{i}Y
\]

\end_inset

The monopolist demands production labor:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ell_{is}=\frac{c_{i}y_{is}}{\phi_{i}},\Rightarrow L_{i}=\int\ell_{is}\mathrm{d}s=Y\frac{\beta_{i}}{\phi_{i}w}\label{eq: SectorL}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Assuming a rigid production labor supply:
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Consider a labor supply with elasticity 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi$
\end_inset

.
 This gives:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\chi w^{\varphi}=\frac{Y}{w}\left(\sum\frac{\beta_{i}}{\phi_{i}c_{i}}\right)\Rightarrow w=\left[\frac{Y}{\chi}\left(\sum\frac{\beta_{i}}{\phi_{i}c_{i}}\right)\right]^{\frac{1}{1+\varphi}}
\]

\end_inset

Equilibrium labor is then:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L^{\star}=\chi\left[\frac{Y}{\chi}\left(\sum\frac{\beta_{i}}{\phi_{i}c_{i}}\right)\right]^{\frac{\varphi}{1+\varphi}},\frac{Y}{w}=Y^{\frac{\varphi}{1+\varphi}}\left[\frac{1}{\chi}\left(\sum\frac{\beta_{i}}{\phi_{i}c_{i}}\right)\right]^{-\frac{1}{1+\varphi}}=L^{\star}\left(\sum\frac{\beta_{i}}{\phi_{i}c_{i}}\right)^{-1}
\]

\end_inset

Which results in the same allocations and outputs as below, with 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{\star}$
\end_inset

 in place of the fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L^{s}(w)=L=\frac{Y}{w}\left(\sum\frac{\beta_{i}}{\phi_{i}}\right).\label{eq: prodLClearing}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which gives:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L_{i}=L\frac{\frac{\beta_{i}}{\phi_{i}}}{\sum\frac{\beta_{i}}{\phi_{i}}},Y_{i}=L\frac{\frac{\beta_{i}}{c_{i}}}{\sum\frac{\beta_{i}}{\phi_{i}}}\label{eq: EqSectorLY}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Which gives:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y=L\prod_{i}\left(\frac{\frac{\beta_{i}}{c_{i}}}{\sum\frac{\beta_{i}}{\phi_{i}}}\right)^{\beta_{i}}\label{eq: EqFinalY}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Thus, growth is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-\sum\beta_{i}\Delta\log c_{i}\label{eq: EqGrowth}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Normalized values in each sector are the same as before, with the only differenc
e that they receive a wage 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{R},$
\end_inset

 and the above 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{I},\zeta$

 are replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta w^{R},\alpha_{I}w^{R}.$

\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{RD}$
\end_inset

 is the normalized researchers' wage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a normalized wage, each sector demands:
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset

The stationary distribution within each sector is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\mu_{\omega,i}\left(w^{RD}\right) & =\frac{x_{I,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)}{x_{e,\omega,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)+\delta_{i}+x_{I,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)},\label{eq: StatDist1}\\
\mu_{1,i}\left(w^{RD}\right) & =\frac{x_{e,\omega,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)+\delta_{i}}{x_{e,\omega,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)+\delta_{i}+x_{I,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)},\label{eq: StatDist2}\\
\mu_{e,1,i}\left(w^{RD}\right) & =\frac{\omega_{i}\left(x_{e,\omega,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)+\delta\right)\mu_{1,i}+\delta_{i}\mu_{\omega,i}}{\left(x_{I,i}+\omega_{i}\left(x_{e,\omega,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)+\delta_{i}\right)\right)},\label{eq: statDist3}\\
\mu_{e,\omega,i}\left(w^{RD}\right) & =\frac{\omega_{i}\mu_{1,i}x_{I,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)-\omega_{i}\delta_{i}\mu_{\omega,i}}{\left(x_{I,i}+\omega_{i}\left(x_{e,\omega,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)+\delta_{i}\right)\right)}+\mu_{\omega,i}.\label{eq: statDist4}
\end{align}

\end_inset

Sector RD labor demand is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L_{i}^{RD,d}\left(w^{RD}\right)=\mu_{e,\omega,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)\left(\zeta_{i}\omega_{i}x_{e,\omega,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)\right)+\mu_{1,e,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)\zeta_{i}x_{e,1,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)+\mu_{1,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)\alpha_{I}\frac{x_{I,i}^{2}\left(w^{RD}\right)}{2}.
\]

\end_inset

Market clearing for inventors then reads:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L^{RD,s}\left(w^{RD}\right)=\sum_{i}\left\{ \mu_{\omega,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)\left(\zeta_{i}\omega_{i}x_{e,\omega,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)\right)+\mu_{1,e,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)\zeta_{i}x_{e,1,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)+\mu_{1,i}\left(w^{RD}\right)\alpha_{I}\frac{x_{I,i}^{2}\left(w^{RD}\right)}{2}\right\} .\label{eq:Inventor Clearing}

 In particular, increased markups in sector 2 bid up aggregate inventors'
 wages, which is accompanied by a reallocation of researchers away from
 sector 1 and towards sector 2.
 At the same time, the inventors accrue more than proportionally to incumbents
 in sector 2, increasing defensive research.
 As a result of higher defensive research, productivity falls in sector
 2.
 The increased productivity is sector 1 is not enough to compensate this
 effect on aggregate output.
 Lower aggregate growth and productivity are also a consequence of misallocation
 across sectors, since in this example, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}=\beta_{2}=.5$
\end_inset

, aggregate growth is maximized when sectoral growth is the same for both
 sectors.
